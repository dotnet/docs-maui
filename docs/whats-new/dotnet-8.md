# What's new in .NET MAUI for .NET 8

.NET 8 is the successor to .NET 7 and focuses on being unified, modern, simple, and *fast*. Due to working with underlying external dependencies, such as Xcode or Android SDK Tools, the .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) support policy differs from the [.NET and .NET Core support policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/maui). For more information, see [.NET MAUI support policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/maui).

In .NET 8, .NET MAUI ships as a .NET workload and multiple NuGet packages. It can be installed via Visual Studio or the `dotnet` command line. The advantage of this approach is that it enables you to easily pin your projects to specific versions, while also enabling you to easily preview unreleased or experimental builds.

This article lists the new features of .NET MAUI for .NET 8 and provides links to more detailed information on each.

For information about what's new in .NET 8, see [What's new in .NET 8](/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-8).

## New functionality

.NET MAUI for .NET 8 addresses top feedback issues and introduces the following new functionality:

- <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebView.Maui.BlazorWebView> gains a `StartPath` property, a `TryDispatchAsync` method, and enhanced logging capabilities. For more information, see [Host a Blazor web app in a .NET MAUI app using BlazorWebView](~/user-interface/controls/blazorwebview.md).
- <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.PointerGestureRecognizer> gains `PointerPressedCommand`, `PointerPressedCommandParameter`, `PointerReleasedCommand`, `PointerReleasedCommandParameter` properties, and `PointerPressed` and `PointerReleased` events. For more information, see [Recognize a pointer gesture](~/fundamentals/gestures/pointer.md).
- <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Devices.Flashlight> gains a `IsSupportedAsync` method that determines whether a flashlight is available on the device. For more information, see [Flashlight](~/platform-integration/device/flashlight.md).
- <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Devices.Sensors.SensorSpeed> intervals have been unified across all platforms. For more information, see [Accessing device sensors](~/platform-integration/device/sensors.md).
- <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.SolidColorBrush.Color> is the [`ContentProperty`](xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ContentPropertyAttribute) of the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.SolidColorBrush> class, and therefore does not need to be explicitly set from XAML.
- The position at which a drag or drop gesture occurred can be obtained by calling the `GetPosition` method on a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.DragEventArgs>, <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.DragStartingEventArgs>, or <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.DropEventArgs> object. For more information, see [Recognize a drag and drop gesture](~/fundamentals/gestures/drag-and-drop.md).
- <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.WebView> gains a `UserAgent` property. For more information, see [WebView](~/user-interface/controls/webview.md).
- Inline media playback of HTML5 video, including autoplay and picture in picture, has been enabled by default for the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.WebView> on iOS. For more information, see [Set media playback preferences on iOS and Mac Catalyst](~/user-interface/controls/webview.md#set-media-playback-preferences-on-ios-and-mac-catalyst).
- Resources defined in a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ResourceDictionary> can also be consumed in an [`AppThemeBinding`](xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Xaml.AppThemeBindingExtension) with the [`DynamicResource`](xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Xaml.DynamicResourceExtension) markup extension. For more information, see [Define and consume theme resources](~/user-interface/system-theme-changes.md#define-and-consume-theme-resources).
- The `Grid.Add` overload that accepts 5 arguments has been added back to .NET MAUI. However, this method is deprecated and is only present to aid migrations from Xamarin.Forms.
- <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Grid> gains an `AddWithSpan` extension method that adds a view to the `Grid` at the specified row and column with the specified row and column spans.
- On iOS, `MauiUIApplicationDelegate` gains a `PerformFetch` method that can be overridden or consumed via the `iOSLifecycle.PerformFetch` delegate. For more information, see [iOS platform lifecycle events](~/fundamentals/app-lifecycle.md#ios).
- The <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.TapGestureRecognizer> class gains the ability to handle secondary taps on Android. For more information, see [Recognize a tap gesture](~/fundamentals/gestures/tap.md).
- The <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.PointerEventArgs> object that accompanies the pointer events raised by the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.PointerGestureRecognizer> class gains a `PlatformArgs` property of type `PlatformPointerEventArgs`. This property provides access to the platform-specific arguments for a pointer gesture event. For more information, see [Recognize a pointer gesture](~/fundamentals/gestures/pointer.md).
- The <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.DragStartingEventArgs>, <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.DragEventArgs>, <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.DropEventArgs>, and <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.DropCompletedEventArgs> objects that accompany drag and drop gesture events each gain a `PlatformArgs` property. This property provides access to the platform-specific arguments for a drag or drop event. For more information, see [Recognize a drag and drop gesture](~/fundamentals/gestures/drag-and-drop.md).
- For troubleshooting purposes, resource generation can be disabled. For more information, see [Disable image packaging](~/troubleshooting.md#disable-image-packaging), [Disable splash screen packaging](~/troubleshooting.md#disable-splash-screen-packaging), [Disable font packaging](~/troubleshooting.md#disable-font-packaging), and [Disable asset file packaging](~/troubleshooting.md#disable-asset-file-packaging).
- For troubleshooting purposes, a blank splash screen can be generated. For more information, see [Generate a blank splash screen](~/troubleshooting.md#generate-a-blank-splash-screen).
- Resizeter checks for duplicate image filenames. For more information, see [Duplicate image filename errors](~/troubleshooting.md#duplicate-image-filename-errors).
- Controls that support text input gain extension methods that support hiding and showing the soft input keyboard. For more information, see [Hide and show the soft input keyboard](~/user-interface/controls/entry.md#hide-and-show-the-soft-input-keyboard).
- The `x:ClassModifier` attribute can be specified on XAML classes, to control the access level for a generated class in an assembly. For more information, see [Class modifiers](~/xaml/class-modifiers.md).
- The <xref:Microsoft.Maui.ApplicationModel.Permissions> class gains the `Bluetooth` permission, which is an Android 12 permission for looking for Bluetooth devices, making the current device discoverable to other Bluetooth devices, and communicating with already-paired Bluetooth devices. For more information, see [Permissions](~/platform-integration/appmodel/permissions.md).
- The <xref:Microsoft.Maui.ApplicationModel.Permissions> class gains the `NearbyWifiDevices` permission, which is an Android 13 permission for accessing nearby WiFi devices. For more information, see [Permissions](~/platform-integration/appmodel/permissions.md).
- Several system fonts can be easily consumed in Android apps. For more information, see [Consume fonts](~/user-interface/fonts.md#consume-fonts).
- Shell navigation gains a `GoToAsync` overload that enables you to pass single use navigation data, that's cleared after navigation has occurred, as a `ShellNavigationQueryParameters` object. For more information, see [Pass single use object-based navigation data](~/fundamentals/shell/navigation.md#pass-single-use-object-based-navigation-data).
- Window management can be decoupled from the `App` class. For more information, see [Decouple window management from the App class](~/fundamentals/windows.md#decouple-window-management-from-the-app-class).
- Menu bar items and context menu items can be invoked through keyboard shortcuts known as keyboard accelerators. For more information, see [Keyboard accelerators](~/user-interface/keyboard-accelerators.md).

The following types or members have been deprecated:

- <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ClickGestureRecognizer> has been deprecated.
- The [`AutomationProperties.Name`](xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.AutomationProperties.NameProperty), [`AutomationProperties.HelpText`](xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.AutomationProperties.HelpTextProperty), and [`AutomationProperties.LabeledBy`](xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.AutomationProperties.LabeledByProperty) attached properties have been deprecated.
- The <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.VisualElement.FocusChangeRequested> has been deprecated. Instead, use the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.IView.Focus> method to attempt to set focus on the view.

The following types or members have been removed:

- The `Application.Properties` property and `Application.SavePropertiesAsync` method have been removed. To migrate your app properties data to .NET MAUI, see [Migrate data from the Xamarin.Forms app properties dictionary to .NET MAUI preferences](~/migration/app-properties.md).
- The `PhoneDialer.Current` property has been removed. Use `PhoneDialer.Default` instead.
- `OpenGLView` has been removed.

The following behavior has changed from the previous release:

- Use of the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Maps.Map> control from XAML now requires the following `xmlns` namespace declaration: `xmlns:maps="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui/maps"`.
- Image caching is disabled on Android when loading an image from a stream with the [`ImageSource.FromStream`](xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ImageSource.FromStream%2A) method. This is due to the lack of data from which to create a reasonable cache key.
- On iOS, pages automatically scroll when the soft input keyboard would cover a text entry field, so that the field is above the soft input keyboard. The `KeyboardAutoManagerScroll.Disconnect` method, in the `Microsoft.Maui.Platform` namespace, can be called to disable this default behavior. The `KeyboardAutoManagerScroll.Connect` method can be called to re-enable the behavior after it's been disabled.
- How the color of a tab is set in a Shell app has changed on some platforms. For more information, see [Tab appearance](~/fundamentals/shell/tabs.md#tab-appearance).

<!-- ## Performance

Performance is a key focus of .NET MAUI in .NET 7:

- On Android, startup performance has improved.
- On iOS, application size has been reduced.
- The rendering path for views has been optimized.
- Many issues have been addressed that impacted the smoothness of scrolling in a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView>.

For more information, see [.NET 7 Performance Improvements in .NET MAUI](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-7-performance-improvements-in-dotnet-maui/). -->

<!-- ## Upgrading from .NET 7

To upgrade your projects from .NET 6 to .NET 7, open your *.csproj* file and change the Target Framework Monikers (TFMs) from 6 to 7. The following example shows the TFMs for a .NET 6 project:

```xml
<TargetFrameworks>net6.0-ios;net6.0-android;net6.0-maccatalyst;net6.0-tizen</TargetFrameworks>
<TargetFrameworks Condition="$([MSBuild]::IsOSPlatform('windows')) and '$(MSBuildRuntimeType)' == 'Full'">$(TargetFrameworks);net6.0-windows10.0.19041</TargetFrameworks>
```

The following example shows the TFMs for a .NET 7 project:

```xml
<TargetFrameworks>net7.0-ios;net7.0-android;net7.0-maccatalyst;net7.0-tizen</TargetFrameworks>
<TargetFrameworks Condition="$([MSBuild]::IsOSPlatform('windows')) and '$(MSBuildRuntimeType)' == 'Full'">$(TargetFrameworks);net7.0-windows10.0.19041</TargetFrameworks>
``` -->
