# What's new in .NET MAUI for .NET 7

.NET 7 is the successor to .NET 6 and focuses on being unified, modern, simple, and *fast*. Due to working with underlying external dependencies, such as Xcode or Android SDK Tools, the .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) support policy differs from the [.NET and .NET Core support policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/maui). For more information, see [.NET MAUI support policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/maui).

This article lists the new features of .NET MAUI for .NET 7 and provides links to more detailed information on each.

For information about what's new in .NET 7, see [What's new in .NET 7](/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-7).

## New functionality

.NET MAUI for .NET 7 addresses top feedback issues and introduces the following new functionality:

- The <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Maps.Map> control is a cross-platform view for displaying and annotating maps. The <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Maps.Map> control uses the native map control on each platform, and is provided by the [Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Maps NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Maps/). For more information, see [Map](~/user-interface/controls/map.md).
- The <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Foldable.TwoPaneView> control is a container control for foldable devices that provides two views that size and position content in the available space, either side-by-side or top-to-bottom. This control is provided by the [Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Foldable NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Foldable/).
- The <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.PointerGestureRecognizer> class performs pointer gesture recognition and detects when the mouse pointer enters, exits, and moves within a view. For more information, see [Recognize a pointer gesture](~/fundamentals/gestures/pointer.md). .NET MAUI also defines a `PointerOver` visual state that can change the visual appearance of a view when it has a mouse cursor hovering over it. For more information, see [Visual states](~/user-interface/visual-states.md).
- The `Window` class defines additional properties and enables the window to be positioned and sized on desktop platforms. For more information, see [.NET MAUI Windows](~/fundamentals/windows.md).
- Tooltips can be displayed for a view, when the user rests a pointer on the view. For more information, see [Display tooltips](~/user-interface/tooltips.md).
- Context menus can be added to any control that derives from <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Element>, on Mac Catalyst and Windows. For more information, see [Display a context menu](~/user-interface/context-menu.md).
- Menu bars can contain separators, which are horizontal lines that separate items in the menu. For more information, see [Display a menu bar](~/user-interface/menu-bar.md).
- Additional .NET MAUI delegates are invoked in response to iOS lifecycle events being raised. For more information, see [App lifecycle](~/fundamentals/app-lifecycle.md#ios).
- The underlying native control for the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.WebView> on iOS and Mac Catalyst can be configured with a `WKWebViewConfiguration` object. For more information, see [Configure the native WebView on iOS and Mac Catalyst](~/user-interface/controls/webview.md#configure-the-native-webview-on-ios-and-mac-catalyst).

In addition, `MessagingCenter` has been deprecated and replaced with `WeakReferenceMessenger` in the [CommunityToolkit.Mvvm NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CommunityToolkit.Mvvm).

## Performance

Performance is a key focus of .NET MAUI in .NET 7:

- On Android, startup performance has improved.
- On iOS, application size has been reduced.
- The rendering path for views has been optimized.
- Many issues have been addressed that impacted the smoothness of scrolling in a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView>.

For more information, see [.NET 7 Performance Improvements in .NET MAUI](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-7-performance-improvements-in-dotnet-maui/).

## Upgrading from .NET 6

To upgrade your projects from .NET 6 to .NET 7, open your *.csproj* file and change the Target Framework Monikers (TFMs) from 6 to 7. The following example shows the TFMs for a .NET 6 project:

```xml
<TargetFrameworks>net6.0-ios;net6.0-android;net6.0-maccatalyst;net6.0-tizen</TargetFrameworks>
<TargetFrameworks Condition="$([MSBuild]::IsOSPlatform('windows')) and '$(MSBuildRuntimeType)' == 'Full'">$(TargetFrameworks);net6.0-windows10.0.19041</TargetFrameworks>
```

The following example shows the TFMs for a .NET 7 project:

```xml
<TargetFrameworks>net7.0-ios;net7.0-android;net7.0-maccatalyst;net7.0-tizen</TargetFrameworks>
<TargetFrameworks Condition="$([MSBuild]::IsOSPlatform('windows')) and '$(MSBuildRuntimeType)' == 'Full'">$(TargetFrameworks);net7.0-windows10.0.19041</TargetFrameworks>
```
