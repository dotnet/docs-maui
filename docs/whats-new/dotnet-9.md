# What's new in .NET MAUI for .NET 9

The focus of .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) in .NET 9 is to improve product quality. This includes expanding test coverage, end to end scenario testing, and bug fixing. For more information about the product quality improvements in .NET MAUI 9, see the following release notes:

- [.NET MAUI 9 RC1](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/releases/tag/9.0.0-rc.1.24453.9)
- [.NET MAUI 9 Preview 7](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/releases/tag/9.0.0-preview.7.24407.4)
- [.NET MAUI 9 Preview 6](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/releases/tag/9.0.0-preview.6.24327.7)

- [.NET MAUI 9 Preview 1](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/releases/tag/9.0.100-preview.1.9973)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to working with external dependencies, such as Xcode or Android SDK Tools, the .NET MAUI support policy differs from the [.NET and .NET Core support policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/maui). For more information, see [.NET MAUI support policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/maui).

In .NET 9, .NET MAUI ships as a .NET workload and multiple NuGet packages. The advantage of this approach is that it enables you to easily pin your projects to specific versions, while also enabling you to easily preview unreleased or experimental builds. When you create a new .NET MAUI project the required NuGet packages are automatically added to the project.

## New controls

.NET MAUI 9 includes two new controls.

### HybridWebView

<xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.HybridWebView> enables hosting arbitrary HTML/JS/CSS content in a web view, and enables communication between the code in the web view (JavaScript) and the code that hosts the web view (C#/.NET). For example, if you have an existing React JS app, you could host it in a cross-platform .NET MAUI native app, and build the back-end of the app using C# and .NET.

To build a .NET MAUI app with <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.HybridWebView> you need:

- The web content of the app, which consists of static HTML, JavaScript, CSS, images, and other files.
- A <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.HybridWebView> control as part of the app's UI. This can be achieved by referencing it in the app's XAML.
- Code in the web content, and in C#/.NET, that uses the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.HybridWebView> APIs to send messages between the two components.

The entire app, including the web content, is packaged and runs locally on a device, and can be published to applicable app stores. The web content is hosted within a native web view control and runs within the context of the app. Any part of the app can access external web services, but isn't required to.

For more information, see [HybridWebView](~/user-interface/controls/hybridwebview.md).

### Titlebar for Windows

The `TitleBar` control provides the ability to add a custom title bar to your app on Windows:

:::image type="content" source="media/dotnet-9/titlebar-overview.png" alt-text=".NET MAUI Titlebar overview." border="false":::

A `TitleBar` can be set as the value of the `Window.TitleBar` property on any `Window`:

```xaml
<Window.TitleBar>
    <TitleBar x:Name="TeamsTitleBar"
              Title="Hello World"
              Icon="appicon.png"
              HeightRequest="46">
        <TitleBar.Content>
            <Entry x:Name="SearchTitleBar"
                   Placeholder="Search"
                   VerticalOptions="Center"
                   MinimumWidthRequest="300"
                   MaximumWidthRequest="450"
                   HeightRequest="32"/>
        </TitleBar.Content>
    </TitleBar>
</Window.TitleBar>
```

An example of its use in C# is:

```csharp
Window.TitleBar = new TitleBar
{
    Title = "MAUI App",
    Icon = "appicon.png",
    HeightRequest = 46,
    LeadingContent = new AvatarButton()
};
```

A `TitleBar` is highly customizable through its `Content`, `LeadingContent`, and `TrailingContent` properties:

```xaml
<TitleBar Title="My App"
          BackgroundColor="#512BD4"
          HeightRequest="48">
    <TitleBar.Content>
        <SearchBar Placeholder="Search"
                   MaximumWidthRequest="300"
                   HorizontalOptions="FillAndExpand"
                   VerticalOptions="Center" />
    </TitleBar.Content>
    <TitleBar.TrailingContent>
        <ImageButton HeightRequest="36"
                     WidthRequest="36"
                     BorderWidth="0"
                     Background="Transparent">
            <ImageButton.Source>
                <FontImageSource Size="16"
                                 Glyph="&#xE713;"
                                 FontFamily="SegoeMDL2"/>
            </ImageButton.Source>
        </ImageButton>
    </TitleBar.TrailingContent>
</TitleBar>
```

The following screenshot shows the resulting appearance:

:::image type="content" source="media/dotnet-9/titlebar-full.png" alt-text=".NET MAUI Titlebar screenshot.":::

> [!NOTE]
> Mac Catalyst support for the `TitleBar` control will be added in a future release.

## Control enhancements

.NET MAUI 9 includes control enhancements.

### BackButtonBehavior OneWay binding mode

The binding mode for `IsVisible` and `IsEnabled` on a `BackButtonBehavior` in a Shell app is now `BindingMode.OneWay` instead of `BindingMode.OneTime`. This enables you to more easily control the behavior of the back button at runtime, with data bindings:

```xaml
<ContentPage ...>    
    <Shell.BackButtonBehavior>
        <BackButtonBehavior Command="{Binding BackCommand}"
                            IsVisible="{Binding IsBackButtonVisible}"
                            IconOverride="back.png" />   
    </Shell.BackButtonBehavior>
    ...
</ContentPage>
```

### BlazorWebView

On iOS and Mac Catalyst 18, .NET MAUI 9 changes the default behavior for hosting content in a `BlazorWebView` to `localhost`. The internal `0.0.0.0` address used to host content no longer works and results in the `BlazorWebView` not loading any content and rendering as an empty rectangle.

To opt into using the `0.0.0.0` address, add the following code to your `MauiProgram` class:

```csharp
// Set this switch to use the LEGACY behavior of always using 0.0.0.0 to host BlazorWebView
AppContext.SetSwitch("BlazorWebView.AppHostAddressAlways0000", true);
```

### CollectionView and CarouselView

.NET MAUI 9 includes two optional new handlers on iOS and Mac Catalyst that bring performance and stability improvements to `CollectionView` and `CarouselView`. These handlers are based on `UICollectionView` APIs.

To opt into using these handlers, add the following code to your `MauiProgram` class:

```csharp
#if IOS || MACCATALYST
builder.ConfigureMauiHandlers(handlers =>
{
    handlers.AddHandler<Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView, Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Handlers.Items2.CollectionViewHandler2>();
    handlers.AddHandler<Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CarouselView, Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Handlers.Items2.CarouselViewHandler2>();
});
#endif
```

### Label text alignment

You can now horizontally align text in <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Label> objects with `HorizontalTextAlignment.Justify`:

```xaml
<Label Text="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. In facilisis nulla eu felis fringilla vulputate."
       HorizontalTextAlignment="Justify"/>
```

### Soft keyboard input support

.NET MAUI 9 adds new soft keyboard input support for `Password`, `Date`, and `Time`. These can be enabled on <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Editor> and <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Entry> controls:

```xaml
<Entry Keyboard="Date" />
```

### TimePicker

<xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.TimePicker> gains a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.TimePicker.TimeSelected> event, which is raised when the selected time changes. The <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.TimeChangedEventArgs> object that accompanies the `TimeSelected` event has `NewTime` and `OldTime` properties, which specify the new and old time, respectively.

### WebView

<xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.WebView> adds a `ProcessTerminated` event that's raised when a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.WebView> process ends unexpectedly. The `WebViewProcessTerminatedEventArgs` object that accompanies this event defines platform-specific properties that indicate why the process failed.

## App lifecycle

.NET MAUI 9 adds the following remote notification lifecycle methods on iOS and Mac Catalyst:

- `RegisteredForRemoteNotifications`, which is invoked when the app has successfully registered for remote notifications.
- `ReceivedRemoteNotifications`, which is invoked when a remote notification is received.

The following example shows how to consume these lifecycle methods:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Maui.LifecycleEvents;

namespace PlatformLifecycleDemo;

public static class MauiProgram
{
    public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
    {
        var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
        builder
            .UseMauiApp<App>()
            .ConfigureLifecycleEvents(events =>
            {
#if IOS || MACCATALYST
                events.AddiOS(ios => ios
                    .ReceivedRemoteNotifications((app, dictionary) => LogEvent(nameof(iOSLifecycle.OnReceivedRemoteNotifications)))
                    .RegisteredForRemoteNotifications((app, data) => LogEvent(nameof(iOSLifecycle.OnRegisteredForRemoteNotifications)));
#endif
                static bool LogEvent(string eventName, string type = null)
                {
                    System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine($"Lifecycle event: {eventName}{(type == null ? string.Empty : $" ({type})")}");
                    return true;
                }
            });

        return builder.Build();
    }
}
```

## Handler disconnection

When implementing a custom control using handlers, every platform handler implementation is required to implement the `DisconnectHandler` method, to perform any native view cleanup such as unsubscribing from events. However, prior to .NET MAUI 9, the `DisconnectHandler` implementation is intentionally not invoked by .NET MAUI. Instead, you'd have to invoke it yourself when choosing to cleanup a control, such as when navigating backwards in an app.

In .NET MAUI 9, handlers automatically disconnect from their controls when possible, such as when navigating backwards in an app. In some scenarios you might not want this behavior. Therefore, .NET MAUI 9 adds a `HandlerProperties.DisconnectPolicy` attached property for controlling when handlers are disconnected from their controls. This property requires a `HandlerDisconnectPolicy` argument, with the `HandlerDisconnectPolicy` enumeration defining the following values:

- `Automatic`, which indicates that handlers will be disconnected automatically. This is the default value of the `HandlerProperties.DisconnectPolicy` attached property.
- `Manual`, which indicates that handlers will have to be disconnected manually by invoking the `DisconnectHandler` implementation.

The following example shows setting the `HandlerProperties.DisconnectPolicy` attached property:

```xaml
<controls:Video x:Name="video"
                HandlerProperties.DisconnectPolicy="Manual"
                Source="video.mp4"
                AutoPlay="False" />
```

The equivalent C# code is:

```csharp
Video video = new Video
{
    Source = "video.mp4",
    AutoPlay = false
};
HandlerProperties.SetDisconnectPolicy(video, HandlerDisconnectPolicy.Manual);
```

In addition, there's a `DisconnectHandlers` extension method that disconnects handlers from a given `IView`:

```csharp
video.DisconnectHandlers();
```

When disconnecting, the `DisconnectHandlers` method will propagate down the control tree until it completes or arrives at a control that has set a manual policy.

## Multi-window support

.NET MAUI 9 adds the ability to bring a specific window to the front on Mac Catalyst and Windows with the `Application.Current.ActivateWindow` method:

```csharp
Application.Current?.ActivateWindow(windowToActivate);
```

## Native embedding

.NET MAUI 9 includes full APIs for native embedding scenarios, which previously had to be manually added to your project:

```csharp
var mauiApp = MauiProgram.CreateMauiApp();

#if ANDROID
var mauiContext = new MauiContext(mauiApp.Services, window);
#else
var mauiContext = new MauiContext(mauiApp.Services);
#endif

var mauiView = new MyMauiContent();
var nativeView = mauiView.ToPlatform(mauiContext);
```

Alternatively, you can use the `ToPlatformEmbedded` method, passing in the `Window` for the platform on which the app is running:

```csharp
var mauiApp = MauiProgram.CreateMauiApp();
var mauiView = new MyMauiContent();
var nativeView = mauiView.ToPlatformEmbedded(mauiApp, window);
```

In both examples, `nativeView` is a platform-specific version of `mauiView`.

To bootstrap a native embedded app in .NET MAUI 9, call the `UseMauiEmbeddedApp` extension method on your `MauiAppBuilder` object:

```csharp
public static class MauiProgram
{
    public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
    {
        var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();

        builder
            .UseMauiEmbeddedApp<App>();

        return builder.Build();
    }
}
```

## Project templates

.NET MAUI 9 adds a **.NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid and Web App** project template to Visual Studio that creates a solution with a .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid app with a Blazor Web app, which share common code in a Razor class library project.

The template can also be used from `dotnew new`:

```dotnetcli
dotnet new maui-blazor-web -n AllTheTargets
```

## Xcode sync

.NET MAUI 9 includes Xcode sync (`xcsync`), which is a tool that enables you to use Xcode for managing Apple specific files with .NET projects, including asset catalogs, plist files, storyboards, and xib files. The tool has two main commands to generate a temporary Xcode project from a .NET project, and to synchronize changes from the Xcode files back to your .NET project.

You use `dotnet build` with the `xcsync-generate` or `xcsync-sync` commands, to generate or sync these files, and pass in a project file and additional arguments:

```dotnetcli
dotnet build /t:xcsync-generate
    /p:xcSyncProjectFile=<PROJECT>
    /p:xcSyncXcodeFolder=<TARGET_XCODE_DIRECTORY>
    /p:xcSyncTargetFrameworkMoniker=<FRAMEWORK>
    /p:xcSyncVerbosity=<LEVEL>
```

For more information, see [Xcode sync](~/macios/xcsync.md).

## Deprecated APIs

.NET MAUI 9 deprecates some APIs, which will be completely removed in a future release.

### Frame

The `Frame` control is marked as obsolete in .NET MAUI 9, and will be completely removed in a future release. The `Border` control should be used in its place. For more information see [Border](~/user-interface/controls/border.md).

### MainPage

Instead of defining the first page of your app using the `MainPage` property on an `Application` object, you should set the `Page` property on a `Window` to the first page of your app. This is what happens internally in .NET MAUI when you set the `MainPage` property, so there's no behavior change introduced by the `MainPage` property being marked as obsolete.

The following example shows setting the `Page` property on a `Window`, via the `CreateWindow` override:

```csharp
public partial class App : Application
{
    public App()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
    }

    protected override Window CreateWindow(IActivationState? activationState)
    {
        return new Window(new AppShell());
    }
}
```

The `MainPage` property is retained for .NET MAUI 9, but will be completely removed in a future release.

### Compatibility layouts

The compatibility layout classes in the `Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Compatibility` namespace have been obsoleted.

### Legacy measure calls

The following `VisualElement` legacy measure methods have been obsoleted:

- `protected override SizeRequest OnMeasure(double widthConstraint, double heightConstraint)`.
- `public virtual SizeRequest Measure(double widthConstraint, double heightConstraint, MeasureFlags flags = MeasureFlags.None)` from `VisualElement`.

As a replacement, the following method has been introduced:

- `public size Measure(double widthConstraint, double heightConstraint)`

This `Measure` method returns the minimum size that an element needs in order to be displayed on a device. Margins are excluded from the measurement, but are returned with the size. This is the preferred method to call when measuring a view.

In addition, the `Microsoft.Maui.SizeRequest` struct is obsoleted. Instead, `Microsoft.Maui.Size` should be used.

## .NET for Android

.NET for Android 9, which adds support for API 35, includes work to reduce build times, and to improve the trimability of apps to reduce size and improve performance. For more information about .NET for Android 9, see the following release notes:

- [.NET for Android 9 RC1](https://github.com/dotnet/android/releases/tag/35.0.0-rc.1.80)
- [.NET for Android 9 Preview 7](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/releases/tag/35.0.0-preview.7.41)
- [.NET for Android 9 Preview 6](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/releases/tag/34.99.0-preview.6.340)
- [.NET for Android 9 Preview 5](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/releases/tag/34.99.0-preview.5.308)
- [.NET for Android 9 Preview 4](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/releases/tag/34.99.0-preview.4.272)
- [.NET for Android 9 Preview 3](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/releases/tag/34.99.0-preview.3.231)
- [.NET for Android 9 Preview 2](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/releases/tag/34.99.0-preview.2.189)
- [.NET for Android 9 Preview 1](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/releases/tag/34.99.0-preview.1.151)

### Asset packs

.NET for Android 9 introduces the ability to place assets into a separate package, known as an *asset pack*. This enables you to upload games and apps that would normally be larger than the basic package size allowed by Google Play. By putting these assets into a separate package you gain the ability to upload a package which is up to 2Gb in size, rather than the basic package size of 200Mb.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Asset packs can only contain assets. In the case of .NET for Android this means items that have the `AndroidAsset` build action.

.NET MAUI apps define assets via the `MauiAsset` build action. An asset pack can be specified via the `AssetPack` attribute:

```xml
<MauiAsset
    Include="Resources\Raw\**"
    LogicalName="%(RecursiveDir)%(Filename)%(Extension)"
    AssetPack="myassetpack" />
```

> [!NOTE]
> The additional metadata will be ignored by other platforms.

If you have specific items you want to place in an asset pack you can use the `Update` attribute to define the `AssetPack` metadata:

```xml
<MauiAsset Update="Resources\Raw\MyLargeAsset.txt" AssetPack="myassetpack" />
```

Asset packs can have different delivery options, which control when your assets will install on the device:

- Install time packs are installed at the same time as the app. This pack type can be up to 1Gb in size, but you can only have one of them. This delivery type is specified with `InstallTime` metadata.
- Fast follow packs will install at some point shortly after the app has finished installing. The app will be able to start while this type of pack is being installed so you should check it has finished installing before trying to use the assets. This kind of asset pack can be up to 512Mb in size. This delivery type is specified with `FastFollow` metadata.
- On demand packs will never be downloaded to the device unless the app specifically requests it. The total size of all your asset packs can't exceed 2Gb, and you can have up to 50 separate asset packs. This delivery type is specified with `OnDemand` metadata.

In .NET MAUI apps, the delivery type can be specified with the `DeliveryType` attribute on a `MauiAsset`:

```xml
<MauiAsset Update="Resources\Raw\myvideo.mp4" AssetPack="myassetpack" DeliveryType="FastFollow" />
```

For more information about Android asset packs, see [Android asset packs](~/android/asset-packs.md).

### Android 15 support

.NET for Android 9 adds .NET bindings for Android 15 (API 35). To build for these APIs, update the target framework of your project:

```xml
<TargetFramework>net9.0-android35</TargetFramework>
```

### LLVM marshalled methods

Low-level Virtual Machine (LLVM) marshalled methods are now enabled by default in .NET for Android 9 in non-Blazor apps. This has resulted in a [~10% improvement in performance in a test app](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/8925).

LLVM marshalled methods can be disabled in your project file (*.csproj*):

```xml
<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(TargetFramework)' == 'net9.0-android'">
    <AndroidEnableLLVM>false</AndroidEnableLLVM>
    <AndroidEnableLLVMOptimizations>false</AndroidEnableLLVMOptimizations>
</PropertyGroup>
```

### Trimming enhancements

.NET for Android 9 includes fixes for when using full trimming to reduce app size. Full trimming is usually only enabled for release builds of your app, and can be configured in your project file (*.csproj*):

```xml
<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)' == 'Release' And '$(TargetFramework)' == 'net9.0-android'">
    <TrimMode>Full</TrimMode>
</PropertyGroup>
```

## .NET for iOS

.NET 9 on iOS, tvOS, Mac Catalyst, and macOS uses Xcode 15.4 for the following platform versions:

- iOS: 17.5
- tvOS: 17.5
- Mac Catalyst: 17.5
- macOS: 14.5

For more information about .NET 9 on iOS, tvOS, Mac Catalyst, and macOS, see the following release notes:

- [.NET 9.0.1xx RC1](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/releases/tag/dotnet-9.0.1xx-rc1-9270)
- [.NET 9.0.1xx Preview 7](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/releases/tag/dotnet-9.0.1xx-preview7-9231)
- [.NET 9.0.1xx Preview 6](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/releases/tag/dotnet-9.0.1xx-preview6-9714)
- [.NET 9.0.1xx Preview 5](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/releases/tag/dotnet-9.0.1xx-preview5-9639)
- [.NET 9.0.1xx Preview 4](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/releases/tag/dotnet-9.0.1xx-preview4-9523)
- [.NET 9.0.1xx Preview 3](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/releases/tag/dotnet-9.0.1xx-preview3-9429)
- [.NET 9.0.1xx Preview 2](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/releases/tag/dotnet-9.0.1xx-preview2-9244)
- [.NET 9.0.1xx Preview 1](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/releases/tag/dotnet-9.0.1xx-preview1-9088)

### Bindings

.NET for iOS 9 introduces the ability to multi-target versions of .NET for iOS bindings. For example, a library project may need to build for two distinct iOS versions:

```xml
<TargetFrameworks>net9.0-ios17.0;net9.0-ios17.2</TargetFrameworks>
```

This will produce two libraries, one using iOS 17.0 bindings, and one using iOS 17.2 bindings.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> An app project should always target the latest iOS SDK.

### Native AOT for iOS & Mac Catalyst

In .NET for iOS 9, native Ahead of Time (AOT) compilation for iOS and Mac Catalyst takes advantage of full trimming to reduce your app's package size and startup performance. This is a publishing feature that you can use when you're ready to ship your app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your app and it's dependencies must be fully trimmable in order to utilize this feature.
