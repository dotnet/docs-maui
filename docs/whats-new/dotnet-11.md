# What's new in .NET MAUI for .NET 11

The focus of .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) in .NET 11 is to improve product quality. For information about what's new in each .NET MAUI in .NET 10 release, see the following release notes:

- [.NET MAUI in .NET 11 Preview 1]()

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to working with external dependencies, such as Xcode or Android SDK Tools, the .NET MAUI support policy differs from the [.NET and .NET Core support policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/maui). For more information, see [.NET MAUI support policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/maui).

In .NET 11, .NET MAUI ships as a .NET workload and multiple NuGet packages. The advantage of this approach is that it enables you to easily pin your projects to specific versions, while also enabling you to easily preview unreleased or experimental builds.
