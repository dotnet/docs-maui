This tutorial series is designed to continue the [Create a .NET MAUI app](../../notes-app/index.yml) tutorial, which created a note taking app. In this part of the series you'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Upgrade your app to .NET 7, if it's currently .NET 6.
> - Implement the model-view-viewmodel (MVVM) pattern.
> - Use an additional style of query string for passing data during navigation.

We highly suggest that you first follow the [Create a .NET MAUI app](../../notes-app/index.yml) tutorial, as the code created in that tutorial is the basis for this tutorial. If you lost the code, or want to start fresh, download [this project](https://github.com/dotnet/maui-samples/raw/main/7.0/Tutorials/ConvertToMvvm/step1_upgrade.zip).
