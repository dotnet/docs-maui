This tutorial series is designed to demonstrate how to create a .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) app that only uses cross-platform code. Meaning, the code you write won't be specific to Windows, Android, iOS, or macOS. The app you'll create will be a note taking app, where the user can create, save, and load multiple notes.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> - Create a .NET MAUI Shell app.
> - Run your app on your chosen platform.
> - Define the user interface with eXtensible Application Markup Language (XAML), and interact with XAML elements through code.
> - Create views and bind them to data.
> - Use navigation to move to and from pages.

You'll use Visual Studio 2022 to create an application with which you can enter a note and save it to device storage. The final application is shown below:
