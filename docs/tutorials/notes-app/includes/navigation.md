This portion of the tutorial introduces the concepts of views, models, and in-app navigation.

In the previous steps of the tutorial, you added two pages to the project: `NotePage` and `AboutPage`. The pages represent a view of data. The `NotePage` is a "view" that displays "note data" and the `AboutPage` is a "view" that displays "app information data." Both of these views have a model of that data hardcoded, or embedded in them, and you'll need to separate the data model from the view.

What is the benefit of separating the model from the view? It allows you to design the view to represent and interact with any portion of the model without worrying about the actual code that implements the model. This is accomplished using data binding, something that will be presented later in this tutorial. For now, though, lets restructure the project.

## Separate the view and model

Refactor the existing code to separate the model from the view. The next few steps will organize the code so that views and models are defined separately from each other.

01. Delete _MainPage.xaml_ and _MainPage.xaml.cs_ from your project, they're no longer needed. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, find the entry for **MainPage.xaml**, right-click it and select **Delete**.

    > [!TIP]
    > Deleting the _MainPage.xaml_ item should also delete the _MainPage.xaml.cs_ item too. If _MainPage.xaml.cs_ wasn't deleted, right-click on it and select **Delete**.

01. Right-click on the **:::no-loc text="Notes":::** project and select **Add** > **New Folder**. Name the folder **:::no-loc text="Models":::**.
01. Right-click on the **:::no-loc text="Notes":::** project and select **Add** > **New Folder**. Name the folder **:::no-loc text="Views":::**.
01. Find the **NotePage.xaml** item and drag it to the **:::no-loc text="Views":::** folder. The **NotePage.xaml.cs** should move with it.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When you move a file, Visual Studio usually prompts you with a warning about how the move operation may take a long time. This shouldn't be a problem here, press **OK** if you see this warning.
    >
    > Visual Studio may also ask you if you want to adjust the namespace of the moved file. Select **No** as the next steps will change the namespace.

01. Find the **AboutPage.xaml** item and drag it to the **:::no-loc text="Views":::** folder. The **AboutPage.xaml.cs** should move with it.

### Update the view namespace

Now that the views have been moved to the **:::no-loc text="Views":::** folder, you'll need to alter the namespaces to match. The namespace for the XAML and code-behind files of the pages is set to `Notes`. This needs to be updated to `Notes.Views`.

01. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, expand both **NotePage.xaml** and **AboutPage.xaml** to reveal the code-behind files:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/navigation/vs-expand-views.png" alt-text="The Notes project with both the Views folder and the page views expanded.":::

01. Double-click on the **NotePage.xaml.cs** item to open the code editor. Change the namespace to `Notes.Views`:

    ```csharp
    namespace Notes.Views;
    ```

01. Repeat the previous step for the **AboutPage.xaml.cs** item.
01. Double-click on the **NotePage.xaml** item to open the XAML editor. The old namespace is referenced through the `x:Class` attribute, which defines which class type is the code-behind for the XAML. This entry isn't just the namespace, but the namespace with the type. Change the `x:Class` value to `Notes.Views.NotePage`:

    ```xaml
    x:Class="Notes.Views.NotePage"
    ```

01. Repeat the previous step for the **AboutPage.xaml** item, but set the `x:Class` value to `Notes.Views.AboutPage`.

### Fix the namespace reference in Shell

The _AppShell.xaml_ defines two tabs, one for the `NotesPage` and another for `AboutPage`. Now that those two pages were moved to a new namespace, the type mapping in the XAML is now invalid. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, double-click on the **AppShell.xaml** entry to open it in the XAML editor. It should look like the following snippet:

```xaml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<Shell
    x:Class="Notes.AppShell"
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
    xmlns:local="clr-namespace:Notes"
    Shell.FlyoutBehavior="Disabled">

    <TabBar>
        <ShellContent
            Title="Notes"
            ContentTemplate="{DataTemplate local:NotePage}"
            Icon="{OnPlatform 'icon_notes.png', iOS='icon_notes_ios.png', MacCatalyst='icon_notes_ios.png'}" />

        <ShellContent
            Title="About"
            ContentTemplate="{DataTemplate local:AboutPage}"
            Icon="{OnPlatform 'icon_about.png', iOS='icon_about_ios.png', MacCatalyst='icon_about_ios.png'}" />
    </TabBar>

</Shell>
```

A .NET namespace is imported into the XAML through an XML namespace declaration. In the previous XAML markup, it's the `xmlns:local="clr-namespace:Notes"` attribute in the root element: `<Shell>`. The format of declaring an XML namespace to import a .NET namespace in the same assembly is:

```xml
xmlns:{XML namespace name}="clr-namespace:{.NET namespace}"
```

So the previous declaration maps the XML namespace of `local` to the .NET namespace of `Notes`. It's common practice to map the name `local` to the root namespace of your project.

Remove the `local` XML namespace and add a new one. This new XML namespace will map to the .NET namespace of `Notes.Views`, so name it `views`. The declaration should look like the following attribute: `xmlns:views="clr-namespace:Notes.Views"`.

The `local` XML namespace was used by the `ShellContent.ContentTemplate` properties, change them to `views`. Your XAML should now look like the following snippet:

```xaml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<Shell
    x:Class="Notes.AppShell"
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
    xmlns:views="clr-namespace:Notes.Views"
    Shell.FlyoutBehavior="Disabled">

    <TabBar>
        <ShellContent
            Title="Notes"
            ContentTemplate="{DataTemplate views:NotePage}"
            Icon="{OnPlatform 'icon_notes.png', iOS='icon_notes_ios.png', MacCatalyst='icon_notes_ios.png'}" />

        <ShellContent
            Title="About"
            ContentTemplate="{DataTemplate views:AboutPage}"
            Icon="{OnPlatform 'icon_about.png', iOS='icon_about_ios.png', MacCatalyst='icon_about_ios.png'}" />
    </TabBar>

</Shell>
```

You should now be able to run the app without any compiler errors, and everything should still work as before.

## Define the model

Currently the model is the data that is embedded in the note and about views. We'll create new classes to represent that data. First, the model to represent a note page's data:

01. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, right-click on the **:::no-loc text="Models":::** folder and select **Add** > **Class...**.
01. Name the class **Note.cs** and press **Add**.
01. Open **Note.cs** and replace the code with the following snippet:

    :::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/navigation/csharp/Notes/Models/Note.cs":::

01. Save the file.

Next, create the about page's model:

01. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, right-click on the **:::no-loc text="Models":::** folder and select **Add** > **Class...**.
01. Name the class **About.cs** and press **Add**.
01. Open **About.cs** and replace the code with the following snippet:

    :::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/navigation/csharp/Notes/Models/About.cs":::

01. Save the file.

## Update About page

The about page will be the quickest page to update and you'll be able to run the app and see how it loads data from the model.

01. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, open the _Views\\AboutPage.xaml_ file.
01. Replace the content with the following snippet:

    :::code language="xaml" source="../snippets/navigation/csharp/Notes/Views/AboutPage.xaml" highlight="4,6-8,14,15,18":::

Let's look at the changed lines, which are highlighted in the previous snippet:

- `xmlns:models="clr-namespace:Notes.Models"`

  This line maps the `Notes.Models` .NET namespace to the `models` XML namespace.

- The `BindingContext` property of the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ContentPage> is set to an instance of the `Note.Models.About` class, using the XML namespace and object of `models:About`. This was set using **property element syntax** instead of an XML attribute.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Until now, properties have been set using an XML attribute. This works great for simple values, such as a `Label.FontSize` property. But if the property value is more complex, you must use **property element syntax** to create the object. Consider the following example of a creating a label with its `FontSize` property set:
  >
  > ```xaml
  > <Label FontSize="22" />
  > ```
  >
  > The same `FontSize` property can be set using **property element syntax**:
  >
  > ```xaml
  > <Label>
  >     <Label.FontSize>
  >         22
  >     </Label.FontSize>
  > </Label>
  > ```

- Three `<Label>` controls had their `Text` property value changed from a hardcoded string to binding syntax: `{Binding PATH}`.

  `{Binding}` syntax is processed at run-time, allowing the value returned from the binding to be dynamic. The `PATH` portion of `{Binding PATH}` is the property path to bind to. The property comes from the current control's `BindingContext`. With the `<Label>` control, `BindingContext` is unset. Context is inherited from the parent when it's unset by the control, which in this case, the parent object setting context is the root object: <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ContentPage>.

  The object in the `BindingContext` is an instance of the `About` model. The binding path of one of the labels binds the `Label.Text` property to the `About.Title` property.

The final change to the about page is updating the button click that opens a web page. The URL was hardcoded in the code-behind, but the URL should come from the model that is in the `BindingContext` property.

01. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, open the _Views\\AboutPage.xaml.cs_ file.
01. Replace the `LearnMore_Clicked` method with the following code:

    :::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/navigation/csharp/Notes/Views/AboutPage.xaml.cs" id="learn_more" highlight="3,6":::

If you look at the highlighted line, the code checks if the `BindingContext` is a `Models.About` type, and if it is, assigns it's assigned to the `about` variable. The next line inside of the `if` statement opens the browser to the URL provided by the `about.MoreInfoUrl` property.

Run the app and you should see that it runs exactly the same as before. Try changing the about model's values and see how the UI and URL opened by the browser also change.

## Update Note page

The previous section bound the **:::no-loc text="about":::** page view to the **:::no-loc text="about":::** model, and now you'll do the same, binding the **:::no-loc text="note":::** view to the **:::no-loc text="note":::** model. However, in this case, the model won't be created in XAML but will be provided in the code-behind in the next few steps.

01. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, open the _Views\\NotePage.xaml_ file.
01. Change the `<Editor>` control adding the `Text` property. Bind the property to the `Text` property: `<Editor ... Text="{Binding Text}"`:

    :::code language="xaml" source="../snippets/navigation/csharp/Notes/Views/NotePage.xaml" highlight="9":::

The modifications for the code-behind are more complicated than the XAML. The current code is loading the file content in the constructor, and then setting it directly to the `TextEditor.Text` property. Here is what the current code looks like:

```csharp
public NotePage()
{
    InitializeComponent();

    if (File.Exists(_fileName))
        TextEditor.Text = File.ReadAllText(_fileName);
}
```

Instead of loading the note in the constructor, create a new `LoadNote` method. This method will do the following:

- Accept a file name parameter.
- Create a new note model and set the file name.
- If the file exists, load its content into the model.
- If the file exists, update the model with the date the file was created.
- Set the `BindingContext` of the page to the model.

01. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, open the _Views\\NotePage.xaml.cs_ file.
01. Add the following method to the class:

    :::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/navigation/csharp/Notes/Views/NotePage.xaml.cs" id="load_note_by_file":::

01. Update the class constructor to call `LoadNote`. The file name for the note should be a randomly generated name to be created in the app's local data directory.

    :::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/navigation/csharp/Notes/Views/NotePage.xaml.cs" id="load_note_ctor" highlight="5-8":::

## Multiple notes and navigation

Currently the **note** view displays a single note, and there isn't a view that represents multiple notes. To display multiple notes, create a new view and model: **AllNotes**.

01. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, right-click on the **:::no-loc text="Views":::** folder and select **Add** > **New Item...**
01. In the **Add New Item** dialog, select **.NET MAUI** in the template list on the left-side of the window. Next, select the **.NET MAUI ContentPage (XAML)** template. Name the file _AllNotesPage.xaml_, and then select **Add**.
01. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, right-click on the **:::no-loc text="Models":::** folder and select **Add** > **Class...**
01. Name the class _AllNotes.cs_ and press **Add**.

### Code the AllNotes model

The new model will represent the data required to display multiple notes. This data will be a property that represents a collection of notes. The collection will be an `ObservableCollection` which is a specialized collection. When a control lists multiple items, such as a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ListView>, is bound to an `ObservableCollection`, the two work together to automatically keep the list of items in sync with the collection. If the list adds an item, the collection is updated. If the collection adds an item, the control is automatically updated with a new item.

01. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, open the _Models\\AllNotes.cs_ file.
01. Replace the code with the following snippet:

    :::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/navigation/csharp/Notes/Models/AllNotes.cs":::

The previous code declares a collection, named `Notes`, and uses the `LoadNotes` method to load notes from the device. This method uses LINQ extensions to load, transform, and sort the data into the `Notes` collection.

### Design the AllNotes page

Next, the view needs to be designed to support the **AllNotes** model.

01. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, open the _Views\\AllNotesPage.xaml_ file.
01. Replace the code with the following markup:

    :::code language="xaml" source="../snippets/navigation/csharp/Notes/Views/AllNotesPage.xaml":::

The previous XAML introduces a few new concepts:

- The `ContentPage.ToolbarItems` property contains a `ToolbarItem`. The buttons defined here are usually display at the top of the app, along the page title. Depending on the platform, though, it may be in a different position. When one of these buttons is pressed, the `Clicked` event is raised, just like a normal button.

  The `ToolbarItem.IconImageSource` property sets the icon to display on the button. The icon can be any image resource defined by the project, however, in this example, a `FontImage` is used. A `FontImage` can use a single glyph from a font as an image.

- The <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> control displays a collection of items, and in this case, is bound to the model's `Notes` property. The way each item is presented by the collection view is set through the  `CollectionView.ItemsLayout` and `CollectionView.ItemTemplate` properties.

  For each item in the collection, the `CollectionView.ItemTemplate` generates the declared XAML. The `BindingContext` of that XAML becomes the collection item itself, in this case, each individual note. The template for the note uses two labels, which are bound to the note's `Text` and `Date` properties.

- The <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> handles the `SelectionChanged` event, which is raised when an item in the collection view is selected.

The code-behind for the view needs to be written to load the notes and handle the events.

01. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, open the _Views/AllNotesPage.xaml.cs_ file.
01. Replace the code with the following snippet:

    :::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/navigation/csharp/Notes/Views/AllNotesPage.xaml.cs":::

This code uses the constructor to set the `BindingContext` of the page to the model.

The `OnAppearing` method is overridden from the base class. This method is automatically called whenever the page is shown, such as when the page is navigated to. The code here tells the model to load the notes. Because the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> in the **AllNotes view** is bound to the **AllNotes model's** `Notes` property, which is an `ObservableCollection`, whenever the notes are loaded, the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> is automatically updated.

The `Add_Clicked` handler introduces another new concept, navigation. Because the app is using .NET MAUI Shell, you can navigate to pages by calling the `Shell.Current.GoToAsync` method. Notice that the handler is declared with the `async` keyword, which allows the use of the `await` keyword when navigating. This handler navigates to the `NotePage`.

The last piece of code in the previous snippet is the `notesCollection_SelectionChanged` handler. This method takes the currently selected item, a **:::no-loc text="Note":::** model, and uses its information to navigate to the `NotePage`. <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Shell.GoToAsync%2A> uses a URI string for navigation. In this case, a string is constructed that uses a query string parameter to set a property on the destination page. The interpolated string representing the URI ends up looking similar to the following string:

```text
NotePage?ItemId=path\on\device\XYZ.notes.txt
```

The `ItemId=` parameter is set to the file name on the device where the note is stored.

Visual Studio may be indicating that the `NotePage.ItemId` property doesn't exist, which it doesn't. The next step is modifying the **:::no-loc text="Note"::: view** to load the model based on the `ItemId` parameter that you'll create.

### Query string parameters

The **:::no-loc text="Note"::: view** needs to support the query string parameter, `ItemId`. Create it now:

01. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, open the _Views/NotePage.xaml.cs_ file.
01. Add the `QueryProperty` attribute to the `class` keyword, providing the name of the query string property, and the class property it maps to, `ItemId` and `ItemId` respectively:

    :::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/navigation/csharp/Notes/Views/NotePage.xaml.cs" id="query_prop":::

01. Add a new `string` property named `ItemId`. This property calls the `LoadNote` method, passing the value of the property, which in turn, should be the file name of the note:

    :::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/navigation/csharp/Notes/Views/NotePage.xaml.cs" id="itemid":::

01. Replace the `SaveButton_Clicked` and `DeleteButton_Clicked` handlers with the following code:

    :::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/navigation/csharp/Notes/Views/NotePage.xaml.cs" id="buttons":::

    The buttons are now `async`. After they're pressed, the page navigates back to the previous page by using a URI of `..`.

01. Delete the `_fileName` variable from top of the code, as it's no longer used by the class.

## Modify the app's visual tree

The `AppShell` is still loading the single note page, instead, it needs to load the **AllPages view**. Open the _AppShell.xaml_ file and change the first <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ShellContent> entry to point to the `AllNotesPage` instead of `NotePage`:

:::code language="xaml" source="../snippets/navigation/csharp/Notes/AppShell.xaml" highlight="12":::

If you run the app now, you'll notice it crashes if you press the **Add** button, complaining that it can't navigate to `NotesPage`. Every page that can be navigated to from another page, needs to be registered with the navigation system. The `AllNotesPage` and `AboutPage` pages are automatically registered with the navigation system by being declared in the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.TabBar>.

Register the `NotesPage` with the navigation system:

01. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, open the _AppShell.xaml.cs_ file.
01. Add a line to the constructor that registers the navigation route:

    :::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/navigation/csharp/Notes/AppShell.xaml.cs" highlight="9":::

The `Routing.RegisterRoute` method takes two parameters:

- The first parameter is the string name of the URI you want to register, in this case the resolved name is `"NotePage"`.
- The second parameter is the type of page to load when `"NotePage"` is navigated to.

Now you can run your app. Try adding new notes, navigating back and forth between notes, and deleting notes.
