Before you can begin this tutorial, you must follow the [Build your first app article](../../../get-started/first-app.md). While creating the project, use the following settings:

- **Project Name**

  This must be set to `Notes`. If the project is named something different, the code you copy and paste from this tutorial may result in build errors.

- **Place solution and project in the same directory**

  Uncheck this setting.
