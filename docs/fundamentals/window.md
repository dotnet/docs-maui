# .NET MAUI windows

The .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) `Window` class provides the ability to create, configure, show, and manage multiple windows.

`Window` defines the following properties:

- `Title`, of type `string`, represents the title of the window.
- `Page`, of type `Page`, indicates the page being displayed by the window. This property is the content property of the `Window` class, and therefore does not need to be explicitly set.
- `FlowDirection`, of type `FlowDirection`, defines the direction in which the UI element of the window are laid out.
- `Overlays`, of type `IReadOnlyCollection<IWindowOverlay>`, represents the collection of window overlays.

These properties, with the exception of the `Overlays` property, are backed by `BindableProperty` objects, which means that they can be targets of data bindings, and styled.

<!-- Todo: Is/will Title be shown on desktop platforms? -->

The `Window` class defines the following modal navigation events:

- `ModalPopped`, with `ModalPoppedEventArgs`, which is raised when a view has been popped modally.
- `ModalPopping`, with `ModalPoppingEventArgs`, which is raised when a view is modally popped.
- `ModalPushed`, with `ModalPushedEventArgs`, which is raised after a view has been pushed modally.
- `ModalPushing`, with `ModalPushingEventArgs`, which is raised when a view is modally pushed.
- `PopCanceled`, which is raised when a modal pop is cancelled.

The `Window` class also defines the following lifecycle events:

- `Created`, which is raised when the Window is created.
- `Resumed`, which is raised when the Window is resumed from a sleeping state.
- `Activated`, which is raised when the Window is activated.
- `Deactivated`, which is raised when the Window is deactivated.
- `Stopped`, which is raised when the Window is stopped.
- `Destroying`, which is raised when the Window is destroyed.
- `Backgrounding`, with `BackgroundingEventArgs`, which is raised when the Window is entering a background state.
- `DisplayDensityChanged`, with `DisplayDensityChangedEventArgs`, which is raised when the effective dots per inch (DPI) for the Window has changed.

For more information about the lifecycle events, and their associated overrides, see [App lifecycle](app-lifecycle.md).

## Create a Window

By default, .NET MAUI creates a `Window` object when you set the `MainPage` property to a `Page` object in your `App` class. However, you can also override the `CreateWindow` method in your `App` class to create a `Window` object:

```csharp
namespace MyMauiApp
{
    public partial class App : Application
    {
        public App()
        {
            InitializeComponent();

            MainPage = new MainPage();
        }

        protected override Window CreateWindow(IActivationState activationState)
        {
            Window window = base.CreateWindow(activationState);

            // Manipulate Window object

            return window;
        }
    }
}
```

While the `Window` class has a default constructor and a constructor that accepts a `Page` argument, which represents the root page of the app, you can also call the base `CreateWindow` method to return the .NET MAUI created `Window` object.

In addition, you can also create your own `Window`-derived object:

```csharp
namespace MyMauiApp
{
    public class MyWindow : Window
    {
        public MyWindow() : base()
        {
        }

        public MyWindow(Page page) : base(page)
        {
        }

        // Override Window methods
    }
}
```

The `Window`-derived class can then be consumed by creating a `MyWindow` object in the `CreateWindow` override in your `App` class.

Regardless of how your `Window` object is created, it will be the parent of the root page in your app.

## Multi-window support

Multiple windows can be simultaneously opened on Android, iOS on iPad (iPadOS), Mac Catalyst, and Windows. This can be achieved by creating a `Window` object and opening it using the `OpenWindow` method on the `Application` object:

```csharp
Window secondWindow = new Window(new MyPage());
Application.Current.OpenWindow(secondWindow);
```

The `Application.Current.Windows` collection, of type `IReadOnlyList<Window>` maintains references to all `Window` objects that are registered with the `Application` object.

Windows can be closed with the `Application.Current.CloseWindow` method:

```csharp
// Close a specific window
Application.Current.CloseWindow(secondWindow);

// Close the active window
Application.Current.CloseWindow(GetParentWindow());
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Multi-window support works on Android and Windows without additional configuration. However, additional configuration is required on iPadOS and Mac Catalyst.

### iPadOS and macOS configuration

To use multi-window support on iPadOS and Mac Catalyst, add a class named `SceneDelegate` to the **Platforms > iOS** and **Platforms > MacCatalyst** folders:

```csharp
using Foundation;
using Microsoft.Maui;
using UIKit;

namespace MyMauiApp;

[Register("SceneDelegate")]
public class SceneDelegate : MauiUISceneDelegate
{
}
```

Then, in the XML editor, open the **Platforms > iOS > Info.plist** file and the **Platforms > MacCatalyst > Info.plist** file and add the following XML to the end of each file:

```xml
<key>UIApplicationSceneManifest</key>
<dict>
  <key>UIApplicationSupportsMultipleScenes</key>
  <true/>
  <key>UISceneConfigurations</key>
  <dict>
    <key>UIWindowSceneSessionRoleApplication</key>
    <array>
      <dict>
        <key>UISceneConfigurationName</key>
        <string>__MAUI_DEFAULT_SCENE_CONFIGURATION__</string>
        <key>UISceneDelegateClassName</key>
        <string>SceneDelegate</string>
      </dict>
    </array>
  </dict>
</dict>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Multi-window support doesn't work on iOS for iPhone.
