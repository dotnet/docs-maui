# App lifecycle

.NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) apps generally have four execution states: *not running*, *running*, *deactivated*, and *stopped*. .NET MAUI raises cross-platform lifecycle events on the `Window` class when an app transitions from the not running state to the running state, the running state to the deactivated state, the deactivated state to the stopped state, the stopped state to the running state, and the stopped state to the not running state.

The following diagram shows an overview of the .NET MAUI app lifecycle:

:::image type="content" source="media/app-lifecycle/app-lifecycle.png" alt-text=".NET MAUI app lifecycle" border="false":::

In the diagram, the gray oval indicates that the app isn't loaded into memory. The light blue ovals indicate that the app is in memory. Text on arcs indicates events that are raised by .NET MAUI, that provide notifications to the running app.

The execution state of an app depends on the app's history. For example, when an app is installed for the first time, or a device is started, the app can be considered to be *not running*. When the app is started, the `Created` and `Activated` events are raised and the app is *running*. If a different app window gains focus, the `Deactivated` event is raised and the app is *deactivated*. If the user switches to a different app or returns to the device's Home screen, so that the app window is no longer visible, the `Deactivated` and `Stopped` events are raised and the app is *stopped*. If the user returns to the app, the `Resuming` event is raised and app is *running*. Alternatively, an app might be terminated by a user while it's running. In this situation the app is *deactivated* then *stopped*, the `Destroying` event is raised, and the app is *not running*. Similarly, a device might terminate an app while it's stopped, due to resource restrictions, and the `Destroying` event is raised and the app is *not running*.

In addition, .NET MAUI enables apps to be notified when platform lifecycle events are raised. For more information, see [Platform lifecycle events](#platform-lifecycle-events).

## Cross-platform lifecycle events

The `Window` class defines the following cross-platform lifecycle events:

| Event | Description | Action to take |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `Created` | This event is raised after the native window has been created. At this point the cross-platform window will have a native window handler, but the window might not be visible yet. |  |
| `Activated` | This event is raised when the window has been activated, and is, or will become, the focused window. |  |
| `Deactivated` | This event is raised when the window is no longer the focused window. However, the window might still be visible. |  |
| `Stopped` | This event is raised when the window is no longer visible. There's no guarantee that an app will resume from this state, because it may be terminated by the operating system. | Disconnect from any long running processes, or cancel any pending requests that might consume device resources. |
| `Resumed` | This event is raised when an app resumes after being stopped. This event won't be raised the first time your app launches, and can only be raised if the `Stopped` event has previously been raised. | Subscribe to any required events, and refresh any content that's on the visible page. |
| `Destroying` | This event is raised when the native window is being destroyed and deallocated. The same cross-platform window might be used against a new native window when the app is reopened. | Remove any event subscriptions that you've attached to the native window. |

These cross-platform events map to different platform events, and the following table shows this mapping:

| Event | Android | iOS | Windows |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `Created` | `OnPostCreate` | `FinishedLaunching` | `Created` |
| `Activated` | `OnResume` | `OnActivated` | `Activated` (`CodeActivated` and `PointerActivated`) |
| `Deactivated` | `OnPause` | `OnResignActivation` | `Activated` (`Deactivated`) |
| `Stopped` | `OnStop` | `DidEnterBackground` | `VisibilityChanged` |
| `Resumed` | `OnRestart` | `WillEnterForeground` | `Resumed` |
| `Destroying` | `OnDestroy` | `WillTerminate` | `Closed` |

In addition, the `Window` class also defines a `Backgrounding` event that's raised on iOS and Mac Catalyst when the Window is closed or enters a background state. A `BackgroundingEventArgs` object accompanies this event, and any `string` state should be persisted to the `State` property of the `BackgroundingEventArgs` object, which the OS will preserve until it's time to resume the window. When the window is resumed the state is provided by the `IActivationState` argument to the `CreateWindow` override.

In addition to these events, the `Window` class also has the following overridable lifecycle methods:

- `OnCreated`, which is invoked when the `Created` event is raised.
- `OnActivated`, which is invoked when the `Activated` event is raised.
- `OnDeactivated`, which is invoked when the `Deactivated` event is raised.
- `OnStopped`, which is invoked when the `Stopped` event is raised.
- `OnResumed`, which is invoked when the `Resumed` event is raised.
- `OnDestroying`, which is invoked when the `Destroying` event is raised.
- `OnBackgrounding`, which is invoked when the `Backgrounding` event is raised.

To subscribe to the `Window` lifecycle events, override the `CreateWindow` method in your `App` class to create a `Window` instance on which you can subscribe to events:

```csharp
namespace MyMauiApp
{
    public partial class App : Application
    {
        public App()
        {
            InitializeComponent();

            MainPage = new MainPage();
        }

        protected override Window CreateWindow(IActivationState activationState)
        {
            Window window = base.CreateWindow(activationState);

            window.Created += (s, e) =>
            {
                // Custom logic
            };

            return window;
        }
    }
}
```

Alternatively, to consume the lifecycle overrides, create a class that derives from the `Window` class

```csharp
namespace MyMauiApp
{
    public class MyWindow : Window
    {
        public MyWindow() : base()
        {
        }

        public MyWindow(Page page) : base(page)
        {
        }

        protected override void OnCreated()
        {
            // Register services
        }
    }
}
```

The `Window`-derived class can then be consumed by overriding the `CreateWindow` method in your `App` class to return a `MyWindow` instance.

> [!WARNING]
> An `InvalidOperationException` will be thrown if the `App.MainPage` property is set and the `CreateWindow` method creates a `Window` object using the override that accepts a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Page> argument.

## Platform lifecycle events

.NET MAUI defines delegates that are invoked in response to platform lifecycle events being raised. Handlers can be specified for these delegates, using named methods or anonymous functions, which are executed when the delegate is invoked. This mechanism enables apps to be notified when common platform lifecycle events are raised.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `ConfigureLifecycleEvents` method is in the `Microsoft.Maui.LifecycleEvents` namespace.

### Android

The following table lists the .NET MAUI delegates that are invoked in response to Android lifecycle events being raised:

| Delegate | Arguments | Description | Comments |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `OnActivityResult` | `Android.App.Activity`, `int`, `Android.App.Result`, `Android.Content.Intent?` | Invoked when an activity you launched exits. |  |
| `OnApplicationConfigurationChanged` | `Android.App.Application`, `Android.Content.Res.Configuration` | Invoked when the device configuration changes while your component is running. |  |
| `OnApplicationCreate` | `Android.App.Application` | Invoked when the app has started, before an activity, service, or receiver objects (excluding content providers) have been created. |  |
| `OnApplicationCreating` | `Android.App.Application` | Invoked when the app is starting, before an activity, service, or receiver objects (excluding content providers) have been created. |  |
| `OnApplicationLowMemory` | `Android.App.Application` | Invoked when the system is running low on memory, and actively running processes should trim their memory usage. |  |
| `OnApplicationTrimMemory` | `Android.App.Application`, `Android.Content.TrimMemory` | Invoked when the operating system has determined that it's a good time for a process to trim unneeded memory from its process. |  |
| `OnBackPressed` | `Android.App.Activity` | Invoked when the activity has detected a press of the back key. |  |
| `OnConfigurationChanged` | `Android.App.Activity`, `Android.Content.Res.Configuration` | Invoked when the device configuration changes while your activity is running. |  |
| `OnCreate` | `Android.App.Activity`, `Android.OS.Bundle?` | Raised when the activity is created. |  |
| `OnDestroy` | `Android.App.Activity` | Invoked when the activity is finishing, or because the system is temporarily destroying the activity instance to save space. | Always call the super class's implementation. |
| `OnNewIntent` | `Android.App.Activity`, `Android.Content.Intent?` | Invoked when the activity is relaunched while at the top of the activity stack instead of a new instance of the activity being started. |  |
| `OnPause` | `Android.App.Activity` | Invoked when an activity is going into the background, but has not yet been killed. | Always call the super class's implementation. |
| `OnPostCreate` | `Android.App.Activity`, `Android.OS.Bundle?` | Invoked when activity startup is complete, after `OnStart` and `OnRestoreInstanceState` have been called. | Always call the super class's implementation. This is a system-only event that generally shouldn't be used by apps. |
| `OnPostResume` | `Android.App.Activity` | Invoked when activity resume is complete, after `OnResume` has been called. | Always call the super class's implementation. This is a system-only event that generally shouldn't be used by apps. |
| `OnRequestPermissionsResult` | `Android.App.Activity`, `int`, `string[]`, `Android.Content.PM.Permission[]` | Invoked as a callback for the result from requesting permissions. |  |
| `OnRestart` | `Android.App.Activity` | Invoked after `OnStop` when the current activity is being redisplayed to the user (the user has navigated back to it). | Always call the super class's implementation. |
| `OnRestoreInstanceState` | `Android.App.Activity`, `Android.OS.Bundle` | Invoked after `OnStart` when the activity is being reinitialized from a previously saved state. |  |
| `OnResume` | `Android.App.Activity` | Invoked after `OnRestoreInstanceState`, `OnRestart`, or `OnPause`, to indicate that the activity is active and is ready to receive input. |  |
| `OnSaveInstanceState` | `Android.App.Activity`, `Android.OS.Bundle` | Invoked to retrieve per-instance state from an activity being killed so that the state can be restored in `OnCreate` or `OnRestoreInstanceState`. |  |
| `OnStart` | `Android.App.Activity` | Invoked after `OnCreate` or `OnRestart` when the activity has been stopped, but is now being displayed to the user. | Always call the super class's implementation.  |
| `OnStop` | `Android.App.Activity` | Invoked when the activity is no longer visible to the user. | Always call the super class's implementation.  |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each delegate has a corresponding identically named extension method, that can be called to register a handler for the delegate.

To respond to an Android lifecycle delegate being invoked, call the `ConfigureLifecycleEvents` method on the `MauiAppBuilder` object in the `CreateMauiapp` method of your `MauiProgram` class. Then, on the `ILifecycleBuilder` object, call the `AddAndroid` method and specify the `Action` that registers handlers for the required delegates:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Maui.LifecycleEvents;

namespace PlatformLifecycleDemo
{
    public static class MauiProgram
    {
        public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
        {
            var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
            builder
                .UseMauiApp<App>()
                .ConfigureLifecycleEvents(events =>
                {
#if ANDROID
                    events.AddAndroid(android => android
                        .OnActivityResult((activity, requestCode, resultCode, data) => LogEvent(nameof(AndroidLifecycle.OnActivityResult), requestCode.ToString()))
                        .OnStart((activity) => LogEvent(nameof(AndroidLifecycle.OnStart)))
                        .OnCreate((activity, bundle) => LogEvent(nameof(AndroidLifecycle.OnCreate)))
                        .OnBackPressed((activity) => LogEvent(nameof(AndroidLifecycle.OnBackPressed)) && false)
                        .OnStop((activity) => LogEvent(nameof(AndroidLifecycle.OnStop))));
#endif
                    static bool LogEvent(string eventName, string type = null)
                    {
                        System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine($"Lifecycle event: {eventName}{(type == null ? string.Empty : $" ({type})")}");
                        return true;
                    }
                });

            return builder.Build();
        }
    }
}
```

To respond to an iOS lifecycle delegate being invoked, call the `ConfigureLifecycleEvents` method on the `MauiAppBuilder` object in the `CreateMauiapp` method of your `MauiProgram` class. Then, on the `ILifecycleBuilder` object, call the `AddiOS` method and specify the `Action` that registers handlers for the required delegates:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Maui.LifecycleEvents;

namespace PlatformLifecycleDemo
{
    public static class MauiProgram
    {
        public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
        {
            var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
            builder
                .UseMauiApp<App>()
                .ConfigureLifecycleEvents(events =>
                {
#if IOS
                    events.AddiOS(ios => ios
                        .OnActivated((app) => LogEvent(nameof(iOSLifecycle.OnActivated)))
                        .OnResignActivation((app) => LogEvent(nameof(iOSLifecycle.OnResignActivation)))
                        .DidEnterBackground((app) => LogEvent(nameof(iOSLifecycle.DidEnterBackground)))
                        .WillTerminate((app) => LogEvent(nameof(iOSLifecycle.WillTerminate))));
#endif
                    static bool LogEvent(string eventName, string type = null)
                    {
                        System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine($"Lifecycle event: {eventName}{(type == null ? string.Empty : $" ({type})")}");
                        return true;
                    }
                });

            return builder.Build();
        }
    }
}
```

For more information about the iOS app lifecycle, see [Managing Your App's Life Cycle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/managing_your_app_s_life_cycle?language=objc) on developer.apple.com.

### Windows

The following table lists the .NET MAUI delegates that are invoked in response to Windows lifecycle events being raised:

| Delegate | Arguments | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `OnActivated` | `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Window`, `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.WindowActivatedEventArgs` | Invoked when the platform <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Window.Activated> event is raised, if the app isn't resuming. |
| `OnClosed` | `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Window`, `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.WindowEventArgs` | Invoked when the platform <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Window.Closed> event is raised. |
| `OnLaunched` | `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Window`, `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.LaunchActivatedEventArgs` | Invoked by .NET MAUI's <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Application.OnLaunched%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> override once the native window has been created and activated. |
| `OnLaunching` | `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Window`, `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.LaunchActivatedEventArgs` | Invoked by .NET MAUI's <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Application.OnLaunched%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> override before the native window has been created and activated. |
| `OnPlatformMessage` | `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Window`, `WindowsPlatformMessageEventArgs` | Invoked when .NET MAUI receives specific native Windows messages. |
| `OnPlatformWindowSubclassed` | `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Window`, `WindowsPlatformWindowSubclassedEventArgs` | Invoked by .NET MAUI when the Win32 window is subclassed. |
| `OnResumed` | `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Window` | Invoked when the platform [`Activated`](xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Window.Activated) event is raised, if the app is resuming. |
| `OnVisibilityChanged` | `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Window`, `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.WindowVisibilityChangedEventArgs` | Invoked when the platform <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Window.VisibilityChanged> event is raised. |
| `OnWindowCreated` | `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Window` | Invoked when the native window is created for the cross-platform `Window`. |

.NET MAUI exposes specific native Windows messages as a lifecycle event with the `OnPlatformMessage` delegate. The `WindowsPlatformMessageEventArgs` object that accompanies this delegate includes a `MessageId` property, of type `uint`. The value of this property can be examined to determine which message has been passed to your app window. For more information about windows messages, see [Windows Messages (Get Started with Win32 and C++)](/windows/win32/learnwin32/window-messages). For a list of window message constants, see [Window notifications](/windows/win32/winmsg/window-notifications).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each delegate has a corresponding identically named extension method, that can be called to register a handler for the delegate.

To respond to a Windows lifecycle delegate being invoked, call the `ConfigureLifecycleEvents` method on the `MauiAppBuilder` object in the `CreateMauiApp` method of your `MauiProgram` class. Then, on the `ILifecycleBuilder` object, call the `AddWindows` method and specify the `Action` that registers handlers for the required delegates:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Maui.LifecycleEvents;

namespace PlatformLifecycleDemo
{
    public static class MauiProgram
    {
        public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
        {
            var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
            builder
                .UseMauiApp<App>()
                .ConfigureLifecycleEvents(events =>
                {
#if WINDOWS
                    events.AddWindows(windows => windows
                           .OnActivated((window, args) => LogEvent(nameof(WindowsLifecycle.OnActivated)))
                           .OnClosed((window, args) => LogEvent(nameof(WindowsLifecycle.OnClosed)))
                           .OnLaunched((window, args) => LogEvent(nameof(WindowsLifecycle.OnLaunched)))
                           .OnLaunching((window, args) => LogEvent(nameof(WindowsLifecycle.OnLaunching)))
                           .OnVisibilityChanged((window, args) => LogEvent(nameof(WindowsLifecycle.OnVisibilityChanged)))
                           .OnPlatformMessage((window, args) =>
                           {
                               if (args.MessageId == Convert.ToUInt32("031A", 16))
                               {
                                   // System theme has changed
                               }
                           }));
#endif
                    static bool LogEvent(string eventName, string type = null)
                    {
                        System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine($"Lifecycle event: {eventName}{(type == null ? string.Empty : $" ({type})")}");
                        return true;
                    }
                });

            return builder.Build();
        }
    }
}
```

### Retrieve the Window object

Platform code can retrieve the app's `Window` object from platform lifecycle events, with the `GetWindow` extension method:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Maui.LifecycleEvents;

namespace PlatformLifecycleDemo
{
    public static class MauiProgram
    {
        public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
        {
            var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
            builder
                .UseMauiApp<App>()
                .ConfigureLifecycleEvents(events =>
                {
#if WINDOWS
                    events.AddWindows(windows => windows
                            .OnClosed((window, args) =>
                            {
                                IWindow appWindow = window.GetWindow();
                            }));
#endif
                });

            return builder.Build();
        }
    }
}
```

## Custom lifecycle events

While .NET MAUI defines delegates that are invoked in response to platform lifecycle events being raised, it only exposes a common set of platform lifecycle events. However, it also includes a mechanism, typically for library authors, that enables apps to be notified when additional platform lifecycle events are raised. The process for accomplishing this is as follows:

- Register an event handler for a platform lifecycle event that isn't exposed by .NET MAUI.
- In the event handler for the platform lifecycle event, retrieve the `ILifecycleEventService` instance and call its `InvokeEvents` method, specifying the platform event name as its argument.

Then, apps that want to receive notification of the platform lifecycle event should modify the `CreateMauiApp` method of their `MauiProgram` class to call the `ConfigureLifecycleEvents` method on the `MauiAppBuilder` object. Then, on the `ILifecycleBuilder` object, call the `AddEvent` method and specify the platform event name and the `Action` that will be invoked when the platform event is raised.

### Example

The WinUI 3 <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Window.SizeChanged?displayProperty=nameWithType> event occurs when the native app window has first rendered, or has changed its rendering size. .NET MAUI doesn't expose this platform event as a lifecycle event. However, apps can receive notification when this platform event is raised by using the following approach:

- Register an event handler for the <xref:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Window.SizeChanged?displayProperty=nameWithType> platform lifecycle event:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.Maui.LifecycleEvents;
    ...

    public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
    {
          var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
          builder
                .UseMauiApp<App>()
                .ConfigureLifecycleEvents(events =>
                {
    #if WINDOWS
                      events.AddWindows(windows => windows
                             .OnWindowCreated(window =>
                             {
                                    window.SizeChanged += OnSizeChanged;
                             }));
    #endif
                });

          return builder.Build();
    }    
    ```

- In the event handler for the platform lifecycle event, retrieve the `ILifecycleEventService` instance and call its `InvokeEvents` method, specifying the platform event name as its argument:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.Maui.LifecycleEvents;
    ...

    #if WINDOWS
            static void OnSizeChanged(object sender, Microsoft.UI.Xaml.WindowSizeChangedEventArgs args)
            {
                ILifecycleEventService service = MauiWinUIApplication.Current.Services.GetRequiredService<ILifecycleEventService>();
                service.InvokeEvents(nameof(Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Window.SizeChanged));
            }
    #endif
    ```

    The `MauiWinUIApplication` type on Windows can be used to access the native app instance via its `Current` property. The `MauiApplication` type on Android can be used to access the native app instance. Similarly, the `MauiUIApplicationDelegate` type on iOS can be used to access the native app instance.

    > [!WARNING]
    > Invoking an unregistered event, with the `InvokeEvents` method, doesn't throw an exception.

- In the `CreateMauiApp` method of your `MauiProgram` class, call the `ConfigureLifecycleEvents` method on the `MauiAppBuilder` object. Then, on the `ILifecycleBuilder` object, call the `AddEvent` method and specify the platform event name and the `Action` that will be invoked when the platform event is raised:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.Maui.LifecycleEvents;

    namespace PlatformLifecycleDemo
    {
        public static class MauiProgram
        {
            public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
            {
                var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
                builder
                    .UseMauiApp<App>()
                    .ConfigureLifecycleEvents(events =>
                    {
    #if WINDOWS
                        events.AddWindows(windows => windows
                               .OnWindowCreated(window =>
                               {
                                      window.SizeChanged += OnSizeChanged;
                               }));

                        events.AddEvent(nameof(Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Window.SizeChanged), () => LogEvent("Window SizeChanged"));
    #endif
                        static bool LogEvent(string eventName, string type = null)
                        {
                            System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine($"Lifecycle event: {eventName}{(type == null ? string.Empty : $" ({type})")}");
                            return true;
                        }
                    });

                return builder.Build();
            }
        }
    }
    ```

The overall effect is that when a user changes the app window size on Windows, the action specified in the `AddEvent` method is executed.

> [!NOTE]
> The `AddEvent` method also has an overload that enables a delegate to be specified.
