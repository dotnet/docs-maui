# Recognize a pointer gesture

A .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) pointer gesture recognizer detects when the pointer enters, exits, and moves within a view and is implemented with the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.PointerGestureRecognizer> class. This class defines the following properties:

- <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.PointerGestureRecognizer.PointerEnteredCommand>, of type `ICommand`, which is the command to invoke when the pointer enters the bounding area of the view.
- <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.PointerGestureRecognizer.PointerEnteredCommandParameter>, of type `object`, which is the parameter that's passed to <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.PointerGestureRecognizer.PointerEnteredCommand>.
- <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.PointerGestureRecognizer.PointerExitedCommand>, of type `ICommand`, which is the command to invoke when the pointer that's in the view's bounding area leaves that bounding area.
- <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.PointerGestureRecognizer.PointerExitedCommandParameter>, of type `object`, which is the parameter that's passed to <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.PointerGestureRecognizer.PointerExitedCommand>.
- <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.PointerGestureRecognizer.PointerMovedCommand>, of type `ICommand`, which is the command to invoke when the pointer moves while remaining within the bounding area of the view.
- <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.PointerGestureRecognizer.PointerMovedCommandParameter>, of type `object`, which is the parameter that's passed to <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.PointerGestureRecognizer.PointerMovedCommand>.

These properties are backed by <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.BindableProperty> objects, which means that they can be targets of data bindings, and styled.

The <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.PointerGestureRecognizer> class also defines the following events:

- <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.PointerGestureRecognizer.PointerEntered>, that's raised when the pointer enters the bounding area of the view.
- <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.PointerGestureRecognizer.PointerExited>, that's raised when the pointer that's in the view's bounding area leaves that bounding area.
- <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.PointerGestureRecognizer.PointerMoved>, that's raised when the pointer moves while remaining within the bounding area of the view.

A <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.PointerEventArgs> object accompanies all three events, and defines a `GetPosition` method that returns a `Point?` object that represents the position of the pointer when the gesture was detected. For more information about the `GetPosition` method, see [Get the gesture position](#get-the-gesture-position).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pointer gesture recognition is only supported on iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, and Windows.

.NET MAUI also defines a `PointerOver` visual state. This state can change the visual appearance of a view when it has a mouse cursor hovering over it, but isn't pressed. For more information, see [Visual states](~/user-interface/visual-states.md).

## Create a PointerGestureRecognizer

To make a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.View> recognize pointer gestures, create a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.PointerGestureRecognizer> object, handle the required events, and add the gesture recognizer to the `GestureRecognizers` collection on the view.
Alternatively, create a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.PointerGestureRecognizer> object, and bind the required commands to `ICommand` implementations, and add the gesture recognizer to the `GestureRecognizers` collection on the view.

The following code example shows a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.PointerGestureRecognizer> attached to an <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Image>. The <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.PointerGestureRecognizer> uses events to respond to the detection of pointer gestures:

```xaml
<Image Source="dotnet_bot.png">
    <Image.GestureRecognizers>
        <PointerGestureRecognizer PointerEntered="OnPointerEntered"
                                  PointerExited="OnPointerExited"
                                  PointerMoved="OnPointerMoved" />
  </Image.GestureRecognizers>
</Image>
```

The code for the event handlers should be added to the code-behind file:

```csharp
void OnPointerEntered(object sender, PointerEventArgs e)
{
    // Handle the pointer entered event
}

void OnPointerExited(object sender, PointerEventArgs e)
{
    // Handle the pointer exited event
}

void OnPointerMoved(object sender, PointerEventArgs e)
{
    // Handle the pointer moved event
}
```

The equivalent C# code is:

```csharp
PointerGestureRecognizer pointerGestureRecognizer = new PointerGestureRecognizer();
pointerGestureRecognizer.PointerEntered += (s, e) =>
{
    // Handle the pointer entered event
};
pointerGestureRecognizer.PointerExited += (s, e) =>
{
    // Handle the pointer exited event
};
pointerGestureRecognizer.PointerMoved += (s, e) =>
{
    // Handle the pointer moved event
};

Image image = new Image();
image.GestureRecognizers.Add(pointerGestureRecognizer);
```

## Get the gesture position

The position at which a pointer gesture occurred can be obtained by calling the `GetPosition` method on a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.PointerEventArgs> object. The `GetPosition` method accepts an `Element?` argument, and returns a position as a `Point?` object:

```csharp
void OnPointerExited(object sender, PointerEventArgs e)
{
    // Position inside window
    Point? windowPosition = e.GetPosition(null);

    // Position relative to an Image
    Point? relativeToImagePosition = e.GetPosition(image);

    // Position relative to the container view
    Point? relativeToContainerPosition = e.GetPosition((View)sender);
}
```

The `Element?` argument defines the element the position should be obtained relative to. Supplying a `null` value as this argument means that the `GetPosition` method returns a `Point?` object that defines the position of the pointer gesture inside the window.
