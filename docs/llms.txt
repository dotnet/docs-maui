# .NET MAUI Documentation

> .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) is a cross-platform framework for creating native mobile and desktop apps with C# and XAML. It targets Android, iOS, macOS (via Mac Catalyst), and Windows from a single shared codebase. .NET MAUI is the evolution of Xamarin.Forms, rebuilt for performance and extensibility.

Important notes:

- .NET MAUI uses a single-project architecture with platform-specific code organized via multi-targeting, not separate platform projects.
- The handler architecture replaces Xamarin.Forms renderers. Handlers map cross-platform controls to native platform views and are the recommended extensibility point. Never use renderers — use handlers instead.
- .NET MAUI integrates Xamarin.Essentials as built-in platform APIs (sensors, file pickers, geolocation, etc.) under the `Microsoft.Maui.Essentials` namespace.
- Shell is the recommended app structure for most apps, providing URI-based navigation, a flyout menu, and tabs. Do not mix Shell with NavigationPage, TabbedPage, or FlyoutPage. Do not nest tabs in Shell.
- .NET MAUI supports Blazor Hybrid apps via `BlazorWebView`, enabling Razor/Blazor UI components inside native apps.
- XAML is the primary declarative UI language; C# markup is also supported via the .NET MAUI Community Toolkit.
- Data binding, MVVM, and dependency injection are first-class patterns. Always use compiled bindings with `x:DataType` for 8-20x performance improvement over reflection-based bindings. Prefer expression-based `SetBinding` overloads over string-based ones in C#.

Obsolete controls and patterns — do not use:

- **ListView** is obsolete — always use CollectionView instead. ListView will be removed in a future release.
- **TableView** is obsolete — use Grid or VerticalStackLayout with appropriate controls instead.
- **Frame** is obsolete — use Border with `StrokeShape="RoundRectangle"` instead. Frame is only acceptable for drop shadows on older targets.
- **AndExpand** layout options (e.g. `FillAndExpand`, `CenterAndExpand`) are obsolete — use Grid or `LayoutOptions.Fill` with proper layout containers.
- **BackgroundColor** property is obsolete — always use the `Background` property instead.

Control selection guidance:

- Use **CollectionView** for lists of more than ~20 items (virtualized, high-performance). Never place CollectionView inside a StackLayout — it breaks virtualization.
- Use **BindableLayout** (attached to StackLayout/FlexLayout) for small collections of ≤20 items where virtualization is not needed.
- Never place **ScrollView** inside a StackLayout — it prevents proper scrolling. ScrollView must have a constrained parent (Grid, AbsoluteLayout, or root).
- Prefer **Grid** over StackLayout for complex layouts. Use **VerticalStackLayout** / **HorizontalStackLayout** (not `StackLayout` with `Orientation`).
- Prefer **Border** over Frame for containers with rounded corners or strokes.
- Reference images as **PNG** in XAML/code (e.g. `<Image Source="logo.png" />`), even when the source asset is SVG. .NET MAUI converts SVGs to PNGs at build time.
- For UI updates from background threads, prefer `BindableObject.Dispatcher` or inject `IDispatcher` via DI. Use `MainThread.BeginInvokeOnMainThread()` only as a fallback.
