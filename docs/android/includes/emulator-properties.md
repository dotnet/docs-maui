| `abi.type`                      | **ABI type** &ndash; Specifies the ABI (application binary interface) type of the emulated device. The **x86** option is for the instruction set commonly referred to as "x86" or "IA-32." The **x86_64** option is for the 64-bit x86 instruction set. The **armeabi-v7a** option is for the ARM instruction set with v7-a ARM extensions. The **arm64-v8a** option is for the ARM instruction set that supports AArch64.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | x86, x86_64, armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a       |
| `disk.cachePartition`           | **Cache partition** &ndash; Determines whether the emulated device uses a **/cache** partition on the device. The **/cache** partition (which is initially empty) is the location where Android stores frequently accessed data and app components. If set to **no**, the emulator doesn't use a **/cache** partition and the other `disk.cache` settings are ignored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | yes, no                                   |
| `disk.cachePartition.path`      | **Cache partition path** &ndash; Specifies a cache partition image file on your development computer. The emulator uses this file for the **/cache** partition. Enter an absolute path or a path relative to the emulator's data directory. If not set, the emulator creates an empty temporary file called **cache.img** on your development computer. If the file doesn't exist, it's created as an empty file. This option is ignored if `disk.cachePartition` is set to **no**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                           |
| `disk.cachePartition.size`      | **Cache partition size** &ndash; The size of the cache partition file (in bytes). Normally you don't need to set this option unless the app will download very large files that are larger than the default cache size of 66 megabytes. This option is ignored if `disk.cachePartition` is set to **no**. If this value is an integer, it specifies the size in bytes. You can also specify the size in kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes by appending **K**, **M**, or **G** to the value. The minimum size is **9M** and the maximum size is **1023G**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                           |
| `disk.dataPartition.initPath`   | **Initial path to the data partition** &ndash; Specifies the initial contents of the data partition. After wiping user data, the emulator copies the contents of the specified file to user data (by default, **userdata-qemu.img**) instead of using **userdata.img** as the initial version.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                           |
| `disk.dataPartition.path`       | **Path to the data partition** &ndash; Specifies the user data partition file. To configure a persistent user data file, enter a filename and a path on your development computer. If the file doesn't exist, the emulator creates an image from the default file **userdata.img**, stores it in the filename specified by `disk.dataPartition.path`, and persists user data to it when the emulator shuts down. If you don't specify a path, the default file is named **userdata-qemu.img**. The special value **\<temp>** causes the emulator to create and use a temporary file. If `disk.dataPartition.initPath` is set, its content is copied to the `disk.dataPartition.path` file at boot time. This option can't be left blank.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                           |
| `disk.dataPartition.size`       | **Data partition size** &ndash; Specifies the size of the user data partition in bytes. If this value is an integer, it specifies the size in bytes. You can also specify the size in kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes by appending **K**, **M**, or **G** to the value. The minimum size is **9M** and the maximum size is **1023G**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                           |
| `disk.ramdisk.path`             | **Ramdisk path** &ndash; Path to the boot partition (ramdisk) image. The ramdisk image is a subset of the system image that's loaded by the kernel before the system image is mounted. The ramdisk image typically contains boot-time binaries and initialization scripts. If this option isn't specified, the default is **ramdisk.img** in the emulator system directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                           |
| `disk.snapStorage.path`         | **Snapshot storage path** &ndash; Path to the snapshot storage file where all snapshots are stored. All snapshots made during execution are saved to this file. Only snapshots that are saved to this file can be restored during the emulator run.

| `hw.camera.back`                | **Back-facing camera** &ndash; Configures the back-facing camera (the lens faces away from the user). If you're using a webcam on your development computer to simulate the back-facing camera on the emulated device, this value must be set to webcam*n*, where _n_ selects the webcam (if you have only one webcam, choose **webcam0**). If set to `emulated`, the emulator simulates the camera in software. To disable the back-facing camera, set this value to `none`. If you enable the back-facing camera, be sure to also enable `hw.camera`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | emulated, none, webcam0                   |
| `hw.camera.front`               | **Front-facing camera** &ndash; Configures the front-facing camera (the lens faces towards the user). If you're using a webcam on your development computer to simulate the front-facing camera on the emulated device, this value must be set to webcam*n*, where _n_ selects the webcam (if you have only one webcam, choose **webcam0**). If set to `emulated`, the emulator simulates a camera in software. To disable the front-facing camera, set this value to `none`.

| `hw.camera.maxHorizontalPixels` | **Maximum horizontal camera pixels** &ndash; Configures the maximum horizontal resolution of the emulated device's camera (in pixels).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                           |
| `hw.camera.maxVerticalPixels`   | **Maximum vertical camera pixels** &ndash; Configures the maximum vertical resolution of the emulated device's camera (in pixels).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                           |
| `hw.cpu.arch`                   | **CPU architecture** &ndash; The CPU architecture to be emulated by the virtual device. To simulate an ARM CPU, select **arm** for 32-bit or select **arm64** for a 64-bit ARM CPU. Keep in mind that ARM-based virtual devices run much slower than devices that are x86-based because hardware acceleration isn't available for ARM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | x86, x86_64, arm, arm64                   |
| `hw.cpu.model`                  | **CPU model** &ndash; This value is normally left unset (it will be set to a value that is derived from `hw.cpu.arch` if it isn't explicitly set). However, it can be set to an emulator-specific string for experimental use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                           |
| `hw.dPad`                       | **DPad keys** &ndash; Determines whether the emulated device supports directional pad (DPad) keys. A DPad typically has four keys to indicate directional control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | yes, no                                   |
| `hw.gps`                        | **GPS support** &ndash; Determines whether the emulated device has a GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | yes, no                                   |
| `hw.gpu.enabled`                | **GPU emulation** &ndash; Determines whether the emulated device supports GPU emulation. When enabled, GPU emulation uses Open GL for Embedded Systems (OpenGL ES) for rendering both 2D and 3D graphics on the screen, and the associated GPU Emulation Mode setting determines how the GPU emulation is implemented.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | yes, no                                   |
| `hw.gpu.mode`                   | **GPU emulation mode** &ndash; Determines how GPU emulation is implemented by the emulator. If you select auto, the emulator chooses hardware and software acceleration based on your development computer setup. If you select host, the emulator uses your development computer's graphics processor to perform GPU emulation for faster rendering. If your GPU isn't compatible with the emulator and you are on Windows, you can try angle instead of host. The angle mode uses DirectX to provide performance similar to host. If you select mesa, the emulator uses the Mesa 3D software library to render graphics. Select mesa if you have problems rendering via your development computer's graphics processor. The swiftshader mode can be used to render graphics in software with slightly less performance than using your computer's GPU. The off option (disable graphics hardware emulation) is a deprecated option that can cause improper rendering for some items and is therefore not recommended. | auto, host, mesa, angle, swiftshader, off |

If this path isn't specified, the emulator looks in the emulator system directory for kernel-ranchu.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                           |
| `kernel.supportsYaffs2`         | **YAFFS2 partition support** &ndash; Determines whether the kernel supports YAFFS2 (Yet Another Flash File System 2) partitions. Typically, this support applies only to kernels before Linux 3.10. If set to **autodetect**, the emulator automatically detects whether the kernel can mount YAFFS2 file systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | autodetect, yes, no                       |
| `skin.name`                     | **Skin name** &ndash; The name for an Android emulator skin.
