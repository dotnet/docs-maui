# Editing Android virtual device properties

This article explains how to use the Android Device Manager (AVD) to edit the profile properties of an Android virtual device. For more information about Android virtual devices, see [Create and manage virtual devices](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) on developer.android.com.

## Android Device Manager on Windows

The **Android Device Manager** supports the editing of individual Android virtual device profile properties. The **New Device** and **Device Edit** screens list the properties of the virtual device in the first column, with the corresponding values of each property in the second column (as seen in this example):

:::image type="content" source="media/device-properties/win/new-device-editor.png" alt-text="Example of a new device screen in .NET MAUI.":::

When you select a property, a detailed description of that property is displayed on the right. You can modify hardware profile properties and AVD properties. Hardware profile properties (such as `hw.ramSize` and `hw.accelerometer`) describe the physical characteristics of the emulated device. These characteristics include screen size, the amount of available RAM, whether or not an accelerometer is present. AVD properties specify the operation of the AVD when it runs. For example, AVD properties can be configured to specify how the AVD uses your development computer's graphics card for rendering.

You can change properties by using the following guidelines:

- To change a boolean property, click the check mark to the right of the boolean property:

- To change an *enum* (enumerated) property, click the down-arrow to the right of the property and choose a new value.

- To change a string or integer property, double-click the current string or integer setting in the value column and enter a new value.

## Android Device Manager on macOS

The **Android Device Manager** supports the editing of individual Android virtual device profile properties. The **New Device** and **Device Edit** screens list the properties of the virtual device in the first column, with the corresponding values of each property in the second column (as seen in this example):

[![Example New Device screen.](device-properties-images/mac/01-new-device-editor-sml.png)](device-properties-images/mac/01-new-device-editor.png#lightbox)

When you select a property, a detailed description of that property is displayed on the right. You can modify *hardware profile properties* and *AVD properties*. Hardware profile properties (such as `hw.ramSize` and `hw.accelerometer`) describe the physical characteristics of the emulated device. These characteristics include screen size, the amount of available RAM, whether or not an accelerometer is present. AVD properties specify the operation of the AVD when it runs. For example, AVD properties can be configured to specify how the AVD uses your development computer's graphics card for rendering.

You can change properties by using the following guidelines:

- To change a boolean property, click the check mark to the right of the boolean property:

- To change an *enum* (enumerated) property, click the pull-down menu to the right of the property and choose a new value.

- To change a string or integer property, double-click the current string or integer setting in the value column and enter a new value.
