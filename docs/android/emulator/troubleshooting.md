## Deployment issues on Windows

Some error messages may be displayed by the emulator when you deploy your app. The most common errors and solutions are explained here.

### Deployment errors

If you see an error about a failure to install the APK on the emulator or a failure to run the Android Debug Bridge (**adb**), verify that the Android SDK can connect to your emulator. To verify emulator connectivity, use the following steps:

01. Launch the emulator from the **Android Device Manager** (select your virtual device and select **Start**).

01. Open a command prompt and go to the folder where **adb** is installed. If the Android SDK is installed at its default location, **adb** is located at _C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Android\\android-sdk\\platform-tools\\adb.exe_; if not, modify this path for the location of the Android SDK on your computer.

01. Type the following command:

    ```shell
    adb devices
    ```

01. If the emulator is accessible from the Android SDK, the emulator should appear in the list of attached devices. For example:

    ```shell
    List of devices attached
    emulator-5554   device
    ```

01. If the emulator doesn't appear in this list, start the **Android SDK Manager**, apply all updates, then try launching the emulator again.

### MMIO access error

If the message **An MMIO access error has occurred** is displayed, restart the emulator.

## Missing Google Play Services

If the emulated Android device doesn't have Google Play Services or Google Play Store installed, you probably created a virtual device that excluded these packages. When you [create a virtual device](device-manager.md), be sure to select one or both of the following options:

- **Google APIs**&mdash;includes Google Play Services in the virtual device.
- **Google Play Store**&ndash;includes Google Play Store in the virtual device.

For example, this virtual device will include Google Play Services and Google Play Store:

:::image type="content" source="media/troubleshooting/win/00-add-gps-w158.png" alt-text="Android Device Manager with Google Play Services and Play Store enabled for .NET MAUI.":::

> [!NOTE]
> Google Play Store images are available only for some base device types such as Pixel, Pixel 2, Nexus 5, and Nexus 5X.

## Performance issues

Performance issues are typically caused by one of the following problems:

- The emulator is running without hardware acceleration.
- The virtual device running in the emulator using an Arm-based image.

The following sections cover these scenarios in more detail.

### Hardware acceleration isn't enabled

When you start a virtual device, and you don't have hardware acceleration enabled, the Device Manager displays an error dialog similar to the following image:

:::image type="content" source="media/troubleshooting/win/01-dev-mgr-warning-w158.png" alt-text="Android device manager warning about Hyper-V not enabled on .NET MAUI.":::

To fix this error, follow the troubleshooting steps in the [Hardware acceleration issues](#hardware-acceleration-issues) section.

## Hardware acceleration issues

When using hardware acceleration, you may run into configuration problems or conflicts with other software on your computer. The first step in troubleshooting is verifying that hardware acceleration is enabled. You can use the Android's SDK to check this setting. Open a command prompt and entering the following command:

```cmd
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk\emulator\emulator-check.exe" accel
```

This command assumes that the Android SDK is installed at the default location of _C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Android\\android-sdk_. If the Android SDK is installed elsewhere, modify the preceding command to the correct location.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure the Android Emulator is up to date. From Visual Studio, press **Tools** > **Android** > **Android SDK Manager**. Select the **Tools** tab and see if the **Android Emulator** entry has an update available.

### Hardware acceleration not available

If Hyper-V is available, a message like the following example will be returned from the **emulator-check.exe accel** command:

```cmd
HAXM isn't installed, but Windows Hypervisor Platform is available.
```

If HAXM is available, a message like the following example will be returned:

```cmd
HAXM version 6.2.1 (4) is installed and usable.
```

If hardware acceleration isn't available, a message like the following example will be displayed (the emulator looks for HAXM if it's unable to find Hyper-V):

```cmd
HAXM isn't installed on this machine
```

If hardware acceleration isn't available, see [Enabling Hyper-V acceleration](hardware-acceleration.md#enabling-hyper-v-acceleration-in-windows-and-the-emulator) to learn how to enable hardware acceleration on your computer.

### Incorrect BIOS settings

If the BIOS hasn't been configured properly to support hardware acceleration, a message similar to the following example will be displayed when you run the **emulator-check.exe accel** command:

```cmd
VT feature disabled in BIOS/UEFI
```

To correct this problem, reboot into your computer's BIOS and enable the following options:

- Virtualization Technology (may have a different label depending on motherboard manufacturer).
- Hardware Enforced Data Execution Prevention.

If problems still occur because of issues related to Hyper-V and HAXM, see the following section.

### Hyper-V issues

In some cases, enabling both **Hyper-V** and **Windows Hypervisor Platform** in the **Turn Windows features on or off** dialog may not properly enable Hyper-V. To verify that Hyper-V is enabled, use the following steps:

01. Enter **PowerShell** in the Windows search box.

01. Right-click **Windows PowerShell** in the search results and select **Run as administrator**.

01. In the PowerShell console, enter the following command:

    ```powershell
    Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-All -Online
    ```

    If Hyper-V isn't enabled, a message similar to the following example will be displayed to indicate that the state of Hyper-V is **Disabled**:

    ```cmd
    FeatureName      : Microsoft-Hyper-V-All
    DisplayName      : Hyper-V
    Description      : Provides services and management tools for creating and running virtual machines and their resources.
    RestartRequired  : Possible
    State            : Disabled
    CustomProperties :
    ```

01. In the PowerShell console, enter the following command:

    ```powershell
    Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName HypervisorPlatform -Online
    ```

    If the Hypervisor isn't enabled, a message similar to the following example will be displayed to indicate that the state of HypervisorPlatform is **Disabled**:

    ```cmd
    FeatureName      : HypervisorPlatform
    DisplayName      : Windows Hypervisor Platform
    Description      : Enables virtualization software to run on the Windows hypervisor
    RestartRequired  : Possible
    State            : Disabled
    CustomProperties :
    ```

If Hyper-V or HypervisorPlatform aren't enabled, use the following PowerShell commands to enable them:

```powershell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName HypervisorPlatform -All
```

After these commands complete, reboot.

For more information about enabling Hyper-V (including techniques for enabling Hyper-V using the Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool), see [Install Hyper-V](/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v).

### HAXM issues

HAXM issues are often the result of conflicts with other virtualization technologies, incorrect settings, or an out-of-date HAXM driver.

### HAXM process isn't running

If HAXM is installed, you can verify that the HAXM process is running by opening a command prompt and entering the following command:

```cmd
sc query intelhaxm
```

If the HAXM process is running, you should see output similar to the following result:

```cmd
SERVICE_NAME: intelhaxm
    TYPE               : 1  KERNEL_DRIVER
    STATE              : 4  RUNNING
                            (STOPPABLE, NOT_PAUSABLE, IGNORES_SHUTDOWN)
    WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 0  (0x0)
    SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
    CHECKPOINT         : 0x0
    WAIT_HINT          : 0x0
```

If `STATE` isn't set to `RUNNING`, see [How to Use the Intel Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager](https://software.intel.com/android/articles/how-to-use-the-intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager-intel-haxm-android-emulator) to resolve the problem.

#### HAXM virtualization conflicts

HAXM can conflict with other technologies that use virtualization, such as Hyper-V, Windows Device Guard, and some antivirus software:

- **Hyper-V**—If you're using a version of Windows before the **Windows 10 April 2018 update (build 1803)** and Hyper-V is enabled, follow the steps in [Disabling Hyper-V](#disabling-hyper-v) so that HAXM can be enabled.

- **Device Guard**—Device Guard and Credential Guard can prevent Hyper-V from being disabled on Windows machines. To disable Device Guard and Credential Guard, see [Disabling Device Guard](#disabling-device-guard).

- **Antivirus Software**—If you're running antivirus software that uses hardware-assisted virtualization (such as Avast), disable or uninstall this software, reboot, and retry the Android emulator.

#### Incorrect BIOS settings for HAXM

On Windows, HAXM won't work unless virtualization technology (Intel VT-x) is enabled in the BIOS. If VT-x is disabled, you'll get an error similar to the following when you attempt to start the Android Emulator:

> This computer meets the requirements for HAXM, but Intel Virtualization Technology (VT-x) isn't turned on.

To correct this error, boot the computer into the BIOS, enable both VT-x and SLAT (Second-Level Address Translation) and restart the computer.

#### Disabling Hyper-V

If you're using a version of Windows before the **Windows 10 April 2018 Update (build 1803)** and Hyper-V is enabled, you must disable Hyper-V and reboot your computer to install and use HAXM. If you're using **Windows 10 April 2018 Update (build 1803)** or later, Android Emulator version 27.2.7 or later can use Hyper-V (instead of HAXM) for hardware acceleration, so it isn't necessary to disable Hyper-V.

You can disable Hyper-V from the Control Panel by following these steps:

01. Enter **windows features** in the Windows search box and select **Turn Windows features on or off** in the search results.

01. Uncheck **Hyper-V**:

    :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshooting/win/03-uncheck-hyper-v.png" alt-text="Disable Hyper-V in the Windows Feature dialog for .NET MAUI.":::

01. Restart the computer.

Alternately, you can use the following PowerShell command to disable the Hyper-V Hypervisor:

```powershell
Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-Hypervisor
```

Intel HAXM and Microsoft Hyper-V can't both be active at the same time. Unfortunately, there's no way to switch between Hyper-V and HAXM without restarting your computer.

It's possible that the preceding steps won't succeed in disabling Hyper-V if Device Guard and Credential Guard are enabled. If you're unable to disable Hyper-V, or it seems to be disabled but HAXM installation still fails, use the steps in the next section to disable Device Guard and Credential Guard.

#### Disabling Device Guard

Device Guard and Credential Guard can prevent Hyper-V from being disabled on Windows machines. This situation is often a problem for domain-joined machines that are configured and controlled by an owning organization. On Windows 10, use the following steps to see if **Device Guard** is running:

01. Enter **System info** in the Windows search box and select **System Information** in the search results.

01. In the **System Summary**, look to see if **Device Guard Virtualization based security** is present and is in the **Running** state:

    :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshooting/win/04-device-guard-sml.png" alt-text="Check if Device Guard is running for .NET MAUI." lightbox="media/troubleshooting/win/04-device-guard.png":::

If Device Guard is enabled, use the following steps to disable it:

01. Ensure that **Hyper-V** is disabled (under **Turn Windows Features on or off**) as described in the previous section.

01. In the Windows Search Box, enter **gpedit.msc** and select the **Edit group policy** search result. These steps launch the **Local Group Policy Editor**.

01. In the **Local Group Policy Editor**, navigate to **Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Device Guard**:

    :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshooting/win/05-group-policy-editor-sml.png" alt-text="Check if Device Guard is enabled in the Local Group Policy editor for .NET MAUI." lightbox="media/troubleshooting/win/05-group-policy-editor.png":::

01. Change **Turn On Virtualization Based Security** to **Disabled** (as shown above) and exit the **Local Group Policy Editor**.

01. In the Windows Search Box, enter **cmd**. When **Command Prompt** appears in the search results, right-click **Command Prompt** and select **Run as Administrator**.

01. Copy and paste the following commands into the command prompt window (if drive **Z:** is in use, pick an unused drive letter to use instead):

    ```cmd
    mountvol Z: /s
    copy %WINDIR%\System32\SecConfig.efi Z:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\SecConfig.efi /Y
    bcdedit /create {0cb3b571-2f2e-4343-a879-d86a476d7215} /d "DebugTool" /application osloader
    bcdedit /set {0cb3b571-2f2e-4343-a879-d86a476d7215} path "\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\SecConfig.efi"
    bcdedit /set {bootmgr} bootsequence {0cb3b571-2f2e-4343-a879-d86a476d7215}
    bcdedit /set {0cb3b571-2f2e-4343-a879-d86a476d7215} loadoptions DISABLE-LSA-ISO,DISABLE-VBS
    bcdedit /set {0cb3b571-2f2e-4343-a879-d86a476d7215} device partition=Z:
    mountvol Z: /d
    ```

01. Restart your computer. On the boot screen, you should see a prompt similar to the following message:

    > Do you want to disable Credential Guard?

    Press the indicated key to disable Credential Guard as prompted.

01. After the computer reboots, check again to ensure that Hyper-V is disabled (as described in the previous steps).

If Hyper-V is still not disabled, the policies of your domain-joined computer may prevent you from disabling Device Guard or Credential Guard. In this case, you can request an exemption from your domain administrator to allow you to opt out of Credential Guard. Alternately, you can use a computer that isn't domain-joined if you must use HAXM.

## More troubleshooting tips

The following suggestions are often helpful in diagnosing Android emulator issues.

### Starting the emulator from the command line

If the emulator isn't already running, you can start it from the command line (rather than from within Visual Studio) to view its output. Typically, Android emulator AVD images are stored at the following location: _%userprofile%\\.android\\avd_.

You can launch the emulator with an AVD image from this location by passing in the folder name of the AVD. For example, this command launches an AVD named **Pixel_API_27**:

```cmd
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk\emulator\emulator.exe" -partition-size 2000 -no-boot-anim -verbose -feature WindowsHypervisorPlatform -avd pixel_5_-_api_30 -prop monodroid.avdname=pixel_5_-_api_30
```

This command assumes that the Android SDK is installed at the default location of _C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Android\\android-sdk_. If the Android SDK is installed elsewhere, modify the preceding command to the correct location.

When you run this command, it produces many lines of output while the emulator starts up. Specifically, lines such as the following example are printed if hardware acceleration is enabled and working properly. In this example, HAXM is used for hardware acceleration:

```cmd
emulator: CPU Acceleration: working
emulator: CPU Acceleration status: HAXM version 6.2.1 (4) is installed and usable.
```

### Viewing Device Manager logs

Often you can diagnose emulator problems by viewing the Device Manager logs. These logs are written to the following location: _%userprofile%\\AppData\\Local\\Xamarin\\Logs\\16.0_.

You can view each _DeviceManager.log_ file by using a text editor such as Notepad. The following example log entry indicates that HAXM wasn't found on the computer:

```cmd
Component Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM installer) r6.2.1 [Extra: (Intel Corporation)] not present on the system
```

## Deployment issues on macOS

Some error messages may be displayed by the emulator when you deploy your app. The most common errors and solutions are explained below.

### Deployment errors

If you see an error about a failure to install the APK on the emulator or a failure to run the Android Debug Bridge (**adb**), verify that the Android SDK can connect to your emulator. To verify connectivity, use the following steps:

01. Launch the emulator from the **Android Device Manager** (select
   your virtual device and click **Start**).

01. Open a command prompt and go to the folder where **adb** is installed. If the Android SDK is installed at its default location, **adb** is located at _~/Library/Developer/Xamarin/android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools/adb_; if not, modify this path for the location of the Android SDK on your computer.

01. Type the following command:

   ```shell
   adb devices
   ```

01. If the emulator is accessible from the Android SDK, the emulator should appear in the list of attached devices. For example:

   ```shell
   List of devices attached
   emulator-5554   device
   ```

01. If the emulator doesn't appear in this list, start the **Android SDK Manager**, apply all updates, then try launching the emulator again.

### MMIO access error

If `An MMIO access error has occurred` is displayed, restart the emulator.

## Missing Google Play Services

If the virtual device you're running in the emulator doesn't have Google Play Services or Google Play Store installed, this condition is usually caused by creating a virtual device without including these packages. When you [create a virtual device](device-manager.md), be sure to select one or both of the following:

- **Google APIs** &ndash; includes Google Play Services in the virtual device.
- **Google Play Store** &ndash; includes Google Play Store in the virtual device.

For example, this virtual device will include Google Play Services and Google Play Store:

[![Example AVD with Google Play Services and Google Play Store enabled.](troubleshooting-images/mac/01-google-play-services-m75-sml.png)](troubleshooting-images/mac/01-google-play-services-m75.png#lightbox)

> [!NOTE]
> Google Play Store images are available only for some base device types such as Pixel, Pixel 2, Nexus 5, and Nexus 5X.

## Performance issues

Performance issues are typically caused by one of the following problems:

- The emulator is running without hardware acceleration.
- The virtual device running in the emulator isn't using an x86-based system image.

The following sections cover these scenarios in more detail.

### Hardware acceleration isn't enabled

If hardware acceleration isn't enabled, a dialog may pop up with a message such as **device will run unaccelerated** when you deploy your app to the Android emulator. If you're not certain whether hardware acceleration is enabled on your computer (or you would like to know which technology is providing the acceleration), see [Hardware acceleration issues](#accel-issues-mac) below for steps you can take to verify and enable hardware acceleration.

### Acceleration is enabled but the emulator runs too slowly

A common cause for this problem isn't using an x86-based image in your virtual device. When you [create a virtual device](device-manager.md), be sure to select an x86-based system image:

[![Selecting an x86 system image for a virtual device.](troubleshooting-images/mac/02-x86-virtual-device-m75-sml.png)](troubleshooting-images/mac/02-x86-virtual-device-m75.png#lightbox)

## Hardware acceleration issues

Whether you're using the Hypervisor Framework or HAXM for hardware acceleration of the emulator, you may run into problems caused by installation issues or an out-of-date version of macOS. The following sections can help you resolve this issue.

### Hypervisor Framework issues

If you're using macOS 10.10 or later on a newer Mac, the Android emulator will automatically use the Hypervisor Framework for hardware acceleration. However, some older Macs or Macs running a version of macOS earlier than 10.10 may not provide Hypervisor Framework support.

To determine whether or not your Mac supports the Hypervisor Framework, open a Terminal and enter the following command:

```bash
sysctl kern.hv_support
```

If your Mac supports the Hypervisor Framework, the above command will return the following result:

```bash
kern.hv_support: 1
```

If the Hypervisor Framework isn't available on your Mac, you can follow the steps in [Accelerating with HAXM](~/android/get-started/installation/android-emulator/hardware-acceleration.md?tabs=vsmac#haxm-mac) to use HAXM for acceleration instead.

### HAXM issues

If the Android Emulator doesn't start properly, this problem is often caused by problems with HAXM. HAXM issues are often the result of conflicts with other virtualization technologies, incorrect settings, or an out-of-date HAXM driver. Try reinstalling the HAXM driver, using the steps detailed in [Installing HAXM](~/android/get-started/installation/android-emulator/hardware-acceleration.md?tabs=vsmac#install-haxm-mac).

## Additional troubleshooting tips

The following suggestions are often helpful in diagnosing Android emulator issues.

### Starting the emulator from the command line

If the emulator isn't already running, you can start it from the command line (rather than from within Visual Studio for Mac) to view its output. Typically, Android emulator AVD images are stored at the following location: _~/.android/avd_.

You can launch the emulator with an AVD image from this location by passing in the folder name of the AVD. For example, this command launches an AVD named **Pixel_2_API_28**:

```bash
~/Library/Developer/Xamarin/android-sdk-macosx/emulator/emulator -partition-size 512 -no-boot-anim -verbose -feature WindowsHypervisorPlatform -avd Pixel_2_API_28 -prop monodroid.avdname=Pixel_2_API_28
```

If the Android SDK is installed at its default location, the emulator is located in the _~/Library/Developer/Xamarin/android-sdk-macosx/emulator_ directory; if not, modify this path for the location of the Android SDK on your Mac.

When you run this command, it will produce many lines of output while the emulator starts up. In particular, lines such as the following example will be printed if hardware acceleration is enabled and working properly (in this example, Hypervisor Framework is used for hardware acceleration):

```
emulator: CPU Acceleration: working
emulator: CPU Acceleration status: Hypervisor.Framework OS X Version 10.13
```

### Viewing Device Manager logs

Often you can diagnose emulator problems by viewing the Device Manager logs. These logs are written to the following location: _~/Library/Logs/XamarinDeviceManager_

You can view each **Android Devices.log** file by double-clicking it to open it in the Console app. The following example log entry indicates that HAXM was not found:

> Component Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM installer) r6.2.1 [Extra: (Intel Corporation)] not present on the system
