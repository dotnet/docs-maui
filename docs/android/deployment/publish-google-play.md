The most common approach to distributing Android apps to users is through the Google Play. The first time an app is submitted to Google Play it must be submitted through the Google Play Console. Subsequent versions of the app can be submitted through Visual Studio. In both cases, a Google Play Developer account is required. Apps submitted to Google Play require approval from Google.

To distribute a .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) Android app, you'll need to sign it with a key from your keystore, prior to upload to Google Play. Keystores are binary files that serve as repositories of certificates and private keys.

Google Play requires that you submit your app as an *Android App Bundle* (AAB). Google Play uses your app bundle to generate and serve optimized Android Packages (APK) for each device configuration, so that only the code and resources that are needed for a specific device are downloaded to run your app. For more information about Android App Bundles, see [About Android App Bundles](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle) on developer.android.com.

The process for distributing a .NET MAUI Android app through Google Play is as follows:

1. Create a Google Play Developer account. For more information, see [Create a Google Play Developer account](#create-a-google-play-developer-account).
1. Create your app in Google Play Console. For more information, see [Create your app in Google Play Console](#create-your-app-in-google-play-console).
1. Setup your app in Google Play Console. For more information, see [Setup your app in Google Play Console](#setup-your-app-in-google-play-console).
1. Ensure your app uses the correct package format. For more information, see [Ensure correct package format](#ensure-correct-package-format).
1. Build and sign your app in Visual Studio, and then distribute it through Google Play Console. For more information, see [Distribute your app through Google Play Console](#distribute-your-app-through-google-play-console).

Then, subsequent versions of your app can be published through Visual Studio. For more information, see [Distribute your app through Visual Studio](#distribute-your-app-through-visual-studio).

## Create a Google Play Developer account

To publish Android apps on Google Play, you'll need to create a Google Play Developer account:

1. Using your Google Account, sign up for a [Google Play Developer account](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup).
1. Enter information about your developer identity.
1. During the sign-up process, you'll need to review and accept the [Google Play Developer Distribution Agreement](https://play.google.com/about/developer-distribution-agreement.html).
1. Pay the one-time $25 registration fee.
1. Verify your identity by following the instructions in your verification email.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Identity verification must be complete before you can publish apps through Google Play.

Once your Google Play Developer account has been created you'll be able to begin the process to publish an app to Google Play.

For more information, see [Register for a Google Play Developer account](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6112435?hl=en-GB#zippy=) on support.google.com.

## Create your app in Google Play Console

After you've created your Google Play Developer account, you'll need to create an app in Google Play Console:

1. Login to your [Google Play Developer account](https://play.google.com/apps/publish).
1. In **Google Play Console**, on the **All apps** tab, select the **Create app** button:

    :::image type="content" source="media/publish/vs/google-play-create-new-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the all apps page in Google Play.":::

1. In the **Create app** page, enter your app details and select the **Create app** button:

    :::image type="content" source="media/publish/vs/google-play-create-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new app in Google Play.":::

For more information about creating an app in Google Play Console, see [Create and set up your app](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859152) on support.google.com.

## Setup your app in Google Play Console

After creating your app, you should set it up. Your app's dashboard will guide you through all the most important steps.

To start setting up your app, select **Dashboard** at the left menu. Under your app's details at the top of the page you'll find different categories and tasks relating to app setup and release. You must complete the mandatory tasks before you can launch your app on Google Play. When you complete a task you'll see a green tick mark and strikethrough text. The progress bar at the top of the section will also be updated. For more information, see [Set up your app on the app dashboard](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859454) on support.google.com.

## Ensure correct package format

To publish a .NET MAUI Android app for Google Play distribution requires that your app package format is AAB, which is the default package format for release builds. To verify that your app's package format is set correctly:

1. In Visual Studio's **Solution Explorer** right-click on your .NET MAUI app project and select **Properties**. Then, navigate to the **Android > Options** tab and ensure that the value of the **Release** field is set to **bundle**:

    :::image type="content" source="media/publish/vs/google-play-ensure-package-format.png" alt-text="Screenshot of changing the package format of a .NET MAUI Android app to APK.":::Publish

## Distribute your app through Google Play Console

The first time an AAB is submitted to Google Play, it must be manually uploaded through the Google Play Console. This enables Google Play to match the signature of the key on all future bundles to the original key used for the first version of the app. In order to upload the app through the Google Play Console, it must first be built and signed in Visual Studio.

[!INCLUDE [Publish](../includes/publish-vs.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Publish ad-hoc](../includes/publish-ad-hoc.md)]

The published app can then be released to Google Play via the Google Play Console. To do this you must first create a release in Google Play Console. A release is a combination of one or more app versions that you'll prepare in order to launch an app, or roll out an update. You can create a release on the following tracks:

- Internal testing. Internal testing releases are available to up to 100 testers that you can choose.
- Closed testing. Closed testing releases are available to a limited number of testers that you choose, who can test a pre-release version of your app and submit feedback.
- Open testing. Open testing releases are available to testers on Google Play. Users can join tests from your Store listing.
- Production. Production releases are available to all Google Play users in your chosen countries.

For more information about creating a release in Google Play Console, see [Prepare and roll out a release](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859348) on support.google.com.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> App's submitted to Google Play typically undergo a review process. For more information, see [Prepare your app for review](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859455) and [Publish your app](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859751) on support.google.com.

## Distribute your app through Visual Studio

An AAB must have already been submitted to Google Play, and have passed review, before you can distribute it from Visual Studio. If you attempt to distribute an AAB from Visual Studio that hasn't first been uploaded from the Play Console, you'll receive the following error:

> Google Play requires you to manually upload your first package (APK/AAB) for this app. You can use an ad-hoc package for this.

When this error occurs, manually upload an AAB via the Google Play Console. Subsequent releases of the app can then be published through Visual Studio. However, you must change the version code of the app for each upload, otherwise the following error will occur:

> An AAB with version code (1) has already been uploaded.

To resolve this error, rebuild the app with a different version number and then resubmit it to Google Play via Visual Studio.

> [!NOTE]
> The app's version number can be updated by increasing the value of the `ApplicationVersion` integer property in the app's project file.

Uploading your app from Visual Studio to Google Play first requires you to setup API access in the Google Play Console.

### Enable Google API access

The Google Play Developer Publishing API enables Visual Studio to upload new versions of an app to Google Play. Before Visual Studio can start making API calls, you'll need to set up API access in your Google Play Developer account. This involves linking your Google Play Developer account to a Google Cloud project, and configuring access to the Google Play Developer Publishing API with an OAuth client.

To enable Google API access:

1. Login to your [Google Play Developer account](https://play.google.com/apps/publish).
1. In **Google Play Console**, expand the **Setup** item and select **API access**. Then in the **API access** page, select the **Choose a project to link** button:

    :::image type="content" source="media/publish/vs/api-access-choose-project.png" alt-text="Screenshot of API access page in Google Play Console.":::

    To use Google Play Developer APIs you'll need a Google Cloud project that must be linked to your Google Play Developer account.

    > [!NOTE]
    > A Google Play Developer account can only be linked to a single Google Cloud project. Therefore, if you publish multiple apps from one Google Play Developer account, they all must share the same Google Cloud project.

1. In the **API access** page, select the **Create a new Google Cloud project** radio button followed by the **Save** button:

    :::image type="content" source="media/publish/vs/api-access-create-google-cloud-project.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting the create a new Google Cloud project radio button.":::
