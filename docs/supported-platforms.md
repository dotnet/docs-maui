.NET MAUI apps for Android, iOS, and Windows can be built in Visual Studio. However, a networked Mac is required for iOS development.

On Windows, .NET MAUI apps for Android, iOS, and Windows can also be built with Visual Studio Code when using the .NET MAUI extension. On macOS, .NET MAUI apps for Android, iOS, and macOS can be built in Visual Studio Code when using the .NET MAUI extension.

## Additional platform support

.NET MAUI also includes Tizen support, which is provided by Samsung.

<!-- ## Android platform support

You should have the latest Android SDK Tools and Android API platform installed. You can update to the latest versions using the Android SDK Manager.

Additionally, the target/compile version for Android projects **must** be set to *Use latest installed platform*. However the minimum version can be set to API 21 so you can continue to support devices that use Android 5.0 and newer. -->
