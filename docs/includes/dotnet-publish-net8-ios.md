> [!NOTE]
> In .NET 8, the `dotnet publish` command defaults to the `Release` configuration. Therefore, the build configuration can be omitted from the command line. In addition, the `dotnet publish` command also defaults to the `ios-arm64` `RuntimeIdentifier`. Therefore, the `RuntimeIdentifier` can also be omitted from the command line.
