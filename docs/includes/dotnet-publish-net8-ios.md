> [!NOTE]
> In .NET 8, the `dotnet publish` command defaults to the `Release` configuration. Therefore, the build configuration can be omitted from the command line. In addition, the `RuntimeIdentifier` doesn't have to be specified on the command line because `ios-arm64` is now the default `RuntimeIdentifier`.
