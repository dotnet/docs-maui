# Xamarin.Essentials

TODO: This was part of the original /essentials/ folder. This should be deleted or converted into an proper overview explaining the various facets of device feature access from .NET MAUI. This could also be broken into multiple index.md files in each "essentials" sub section. But it shouldn't be a link farm, it should be a proper overview of the device feature category.

Xamarin.Essentials provides developers with cross-platform APIs for their mobile applications.

Android, iOS, and Windows offer unique operating system and platform APIs that developers have access to all in C# leveraging Xamarin. Xamarin.Essentials provides a single cross-platform API that works with any Xamarin.Forms, Android, iOS, or Windows application that can be accessed from shared code no matter how the user interface is created.
