The most common approach to distributing Mac Catalyst apps to users is through the Mac App Store. Apps are submitted to the Mac App Store through an online tool called *App Store Connect*. Only developers who belong to the Apple Developer Program have access to this tool. Members of the Apple Developer Enterprise Program do not have access. All apps submitted to the Mac App Store require approval from Apple.

Distributing a Mac Catalyst app requires that the app is provisioned using a *provisioning profile*. Provisioning profiles are files that contain code signing information, as well as the identity of the app and its intended distribution mechanism.

To distribute a .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) Mac Catalyst app, you'll need to build a *distribution provisioning profile* specific to it. This profile enables the app to be digitally signed for release so that it can be installed on Macs. A distribution provisioning profile contains an App ID and a distribution certificate. You'll need to create a distribution certificate to identify yourself or your organization, if you don't already have one. In addition, you'll need to create a Mac installer certificate to sign your app's installer package for submission to the Mac App Store.

The process for provisioning a .NET MAUI Mac Catalyst app for distribution through the Mac App Store is as follows:

1. Create a certificate signing request. For more information, see [Create a certificate signing request](#create-a-certificate-signing-request).
1. Create a distribution certificate. For more information, see [Create a distribution certificate](#create-a-distribution-certificate).
1. Create an installer certificate. For more information, see [Create an installer certificate](#create-an-installer-certificate).
1. Create an App ID. For more information, see [Create an App ID](#create-an-app-id).
1. Configure the App ID. For more information, see [Configure the App ID](#configure-the-app-id).
1. Create a provisioning profile. For more information, see [Create a provisioning profile](#create-a-provisioning-profile).
1. Download your provisioning profile. For more information, see [Download your provisioning profile in Xcode](#download-your-provisioning-profile-in-xcode).

Then, once provisioning is complete you should prepare your app for publishing and then publish it with the following process:

1. Add required entitlements to your app. For more information, see [Add entitlements](#add-entitlements).
1. Update the app's *Info.plist* file. For more information, see [Update Info.plist](#update-infoplist).
1. Publish your app using the command line. For more information, see [Publish using the command line](#publish-using-the-command-line).

[!INCLUDE [Create a certificate signing request](../includes/certificate-signing-request.md)]

## Create a distribution certificate

The CSR allows you to generate a distribution certificate, which confirms your identity. The distribution certificate must be created using the Apple ID for your Apple Developer Account:

1. In a web browser, login to your [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/account/).
1. In your Apple Developer Account, select the **Certificates, IDs & Profiles** tab.
1. On the **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles** page, select the **+** button to create a new certificate.
1. On the **Create a New Certificate** page, select the **Apple Distribution** radio button before selecting the **Continue** button:

    :::image type="content" source="media/publish-app-store/apple-distribution-certificate.png" alt-text="Create an Apple distribution certificate.":::

1. On the **Create a New Certificate** page, select **Choose File**:

    :::image type="content" source="media/publish-app-store/choose-certificate.png" alt-text="Upload your certificate signing request for your Apple distribution certificate.":::

1. In the **Choose Files to Upload** dialog, select the certificate request file you previously created (a file with a `.certSigningRequest` file extension) and then select **Upload**.
1. On the **Create a New Certificate** page, select the **Continue** button:

    :::image type="content" source="media/publish-app-store/chosen-certificate.png" alt-text="Continue to generate your distribution certificate.":::

1. On the **Download Your Certificate** page, select the **Download** button:

    :::image type="content" source="media/publish-app-store/download-distribution-certificate.png" alt-text="Download your Apple distribution certificate.":::

    The certificate file (a file with a `.cer` extension) will be downloaded to your chosen location.

1. On your Mac, double-click the downloaded certificate file to install the certificate to your keychain. The certificate appears in the **My Certificates** category in **Keychain Access**, and begins with **Apple Distribution**:

    :::image type="content" source="media/publish-app-store/keychain-access-distribution-certificate.png" alt-text="Keychain Access showing distribution certificate.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > Make a note of the full certificate name in Keychain Access. It will be required when signing your app.

## Create a distribution profile

A distribution provisioning profile enables your .NET MAUI Mac Catalyst app to be digitally signed for release, so that it can be installed on another Mac. A provisioning profile for Mac App Store distribution contains an App ID and a distribution certificate.

[!INCLUDE [Create an App ID](../includes/create-app-id.md)]

### Configure the App ID

By default, a Mac Catalyst app uses the same bundle ID as an iOS app so you can offer the apps together as a universal purchase on the Mac App Store. Alternatively, you can specify a unique bundle ID to offer the app as a separate product.

To configure the App ID:

1. In your Apple Developer Account, navigate to **Certificates, IDs & Profiles**.
1. On the **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles** page, select the **Identifiers** tab.
1. On the **Identifiers** page, select the App ID you just created.
1. On the **Edit your App ID Configuration** page, scroll to the bottom of the page and enable the **Mac Catalyst** capability check-box. Then select the **Configure** button:

    :::image type="content" source="media/publish-app-store/catalyst-capability.png" alt-text="Enable the Mac Catalyst capability.":::

1. In the **Configure Bundle ID for Mac Catalyst** popup, select the **Use existing Mac App ID** radio button. In the **App ID** drop-down, select either the App ID for your Mac Catalyst's partner iOS app, or the the App ID you've created if you're offering the Mac Catalyst app as a separate product. Then, select the **Save button**:

    :::image type="content" source="media/publish-app-store/configure-bundle-id.png" alt-text="Configure the Bundle ID for Mac Catalyst.":::

1. In the **Edit your App ID Configuration** page, select the **Save** button:

    :::image type="content" source="media/publish-app-store/save-catalyst-configuration.png" alt-text="Save the Mac Catalyst configuration.":::

1. In the **Modify App Capabilities** popup, select the **Confirm** button:

    :::image type="content" source="media/publish-app-store/modify-app-capabilities.png" alt-text="Modify the app capabilities.":::

### Create a provisioning profile

Once the App ID has been created and configured, you should create a distribution provisioning profile. This profile enables the app to be digitally signed for release so that it can be installed on Macs.

To create a provisioning profile for Mac App Store distribution:

1. In the Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles page of your Apple Developer Account, select the **Profiles** tab.
1. In the **Profiles** tab, click the **+** button to create a new profile.
1. In the **Register a New Provisioning Profile** page, select the **Mac App Store** radio button before clicking the **Continue** button:

    :::image type="content" source="media/publish-app-store/appstore-register-provisioning-profile.png" alt-text="Register a provisioning profile for app store distribution.":::

1. In the **Generate a Provisioning Profile** page, select the **Mac** radio button. Then, in the **App ID** drop-down, select the App ID that you previously created before clicking the **Continue** button:

    :::image type="content" source="media/publish-app-store/select-app-id.png" alt-text="Select your App ID.":::

    <!-- Commented out because only valid when the Mac Catalyst radio button is selected.
    > [!NOTE]
    > The App ID will be in the **Enabled App IDs with an associated application identifier** section. -->

1. In the **Generate a Provisioning Profile** page, select the radio button that corresponds to your distribution certificate before clicking the **Continue** button:

    :::image type="content" source="media/publish-app-store/appstore-select-certificate.png" alt-text="Select your distribution certificate.":::

1. In the **Generate a Provisioning Profile** page, enter a name for the provisioning profile before clicking the **Generate** button:

    :::image type="content" source="media/publish-app-store/appstore-generate-profile.png" alt-text="Generate the provisioning profile.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > Make a note of the provisioning profile name, as it will be required when signing your app.

1. In the **Generate a Provisioning Profile** page, optionally click the **Download** button to download your provisioning profile.

    > [!NOTE]
    > It's not necessary to download your provisioning profile now. Instead, you will do this in Xcode.

[!INCLUDE [Download certificates and provisioning profiles in Xcode](../includes/download-profiles.md)]

## Add entitlements

Apple's App Sandbox restricts access to system resources and user data in Mac apps, to contain damage if an app becomes compromised. It must be enabled for Mac Catalyst apps that are distributed through the Mac App Store.

[!INCLUDE [Add entitlements](../includes/add-entitlements.md)]

## Update Info.plist

Before publishing your app, you should update its *Info.plist* file with additional information to ensure that the app can be uploaded to the Mac App Store, and to help ensure a smooth Mac App Store review process.

[!INCLUDE [Update Info.plist](../includes/update-info-plist.md)]

### Set the app category

Categories help users discover your app on the Mac App Store. You can set the app's primary category in your *Info.plist* file:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationCategoryType</key>
<string>public.app-category.utilities</string>
```

For more information, see [LSApplicationCategoryType](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/lsapplicationcategorytype) on developer.apple.com.

> [!NOTE]
> Your app's primary category must match the primary category you set in App Store Connect.

### Declare your app's use of encryption

If your app uses encryption, and you plan to distribute it outside the United States or Canada, it's subject to US export compliance requirements. Every time you submit a version of your app to App Store Connect, it undergoes an encryption export regulations compliance review. To avoid App Store Connect asking you questions to guide you through the review, you can provide the required information in your app's *Info.plist* file.

[!INCLUDE [Declare your app's use of encryption](../includes/encryption.md)]

## Publish using the command line

To publish your Mac Catalyst app from the command line on a Mac, open a terminal and navigate to the folder for your .NET MAUI app project. Run the `dotnet publish` command, providing the following parameters:

| Parameter                    | Value                                                                                           |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-f` or `--framework`        | The target framework, which is `net8.0-maccatalyst`.                    |
| `-c` or `--configuration`    | The build configuration, which is `Release`.                                                    |

> [!WARNING]
> Attempting to publish a .NET MAUI solution will result in the `dotnet publish` command attempting to publish each project in the solution individually, which can cause issues when you've added other project types to your solution. Therefore, the `dotnet publish` command should be scoped to your .NET MAUI app project.

Additional build parameters can be specified on the command line, if they aren't provided in a `<PropertyGroup>` in your project file. The following table lists some of the common parameters:

| Parameter                    | Value                                                                                           |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-p:ApplicationTitle` | The user-visible name for the app. |
| `-p:ApplicationId` | The unique identifier for the app, such as `com.companyname.mymauiapp`. |
| `-p:ApplicationVersion` | The version of the build that identifies an iteration of the app. |
| `-p:ApplicationDisplayVersion` | The version number of the app. |

For a full list of build properties, see [Project file properties](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/wiki/Project-file-properties).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Values for all of these parameters don't have to be provided on the command line. They can also be provided in the project file. When a parameter is provided on the command line and in the project file, the command line parameter takes precedence. For more information about providing build properties in your project file, see [Define build properties in your project file](#define-build-properties-in-your-project-file).

For example, use the following command to build and sign a *.pkg* on a Mac, for distribution through the Mac App Store:

```dotnetcli
dotnet publish -f net8.0-maccatalyst -c Release -p:MtouchLink=SdkOnly -p:CreatePackage=true -p:EnableCodeSigning=true -p:EnablePackageSigning=true -p:CodesignKey="Apple Distribution: John Smith (AY2GDE9QM7)" -p:CodesignProvision="MyMauiApp" -p:CodesignEntitlements="Platforms\MacCatalyst\Entitlements.plist" -p:PackageSigningKey="3rd Party Mac Developer Installer: John Smith (AY2GDE9QM7)"
```

## Define build properties in your project file

An alternative to specifying build parameters on the command line is to specify them in your project file in a `<PropertyGroup>`. The following table lists some of the common build properties:

| Property                     | Value                                                                                           |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<ApplicationTitle>` | The user-visible name for the app. |
| `<ApplicationId>` | The unique identifier for the app, such as `com.companyname.mymauiapp`. |
| `<ApplicationVersion>` | The version of the build that identifies an iteration of the app. |
| `<ApplicationDisplayVersion>` | The version number of the app. |
| `<CodesignKey>`             | The name of the code signing key. Set to the name of your distribution certificate, as displayed in Keychain Access. |
| `<CodesignEntitlements>`    | The path to the entitlements file that specifies the entitlements the app requires. Set to `Platforms\MacCatalyst\Entitlements.plist`. |
| `<CodesignProvision>`       | The provisioning profile to use when signing the app bundle. |
| `<CreatePackage>`           | Set to `true` so that a package (*.pkg*) is created for the app at the end of the build.        |
| `<EnableCodeSigning>`       | Set to `true` so that code signing is enabled.                                                  |
| `<EnablePackageSigning>`    | Set to `true` so that the package that's created gets signed.                                   |
| `<MtouchLink>`              | The link mode for the project, which can be `None`, `SdkOnly`, or `Full`.                       |
| `<PackageSigningKey>`       | The package signing key to use when signing the package. Set to the name of your installer certificate, as displayed in Keychain Access. |

For a full list of build properties, see [Project file properties](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/wiki/Project-file-properties).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Values for these build properties don't have to be provided in the project file. They can also be provided on the command line when you publish the app. This enables you to omit specific values from your project file.

The following example shows a typical property group for building and signing your Mac Catalyst app for Mac App Store distribution:

```xml
<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(TargetFramework)|$(Platform)'=='Release|net8.0-maccatalyst|AnyCPU'">
  <MtouchLink>SdkOnly</MtouchLink>
  <EnableCodeSigning>True</EnableCodeSigning>
  <EnablePackageSigning>true</EnablePackageSigning>
  <CreatePackage>true</CreatePackage>
  <CodesignKey>Apple Distribution: John Smith (AY2GDE9QM7)</CodesignKey>
  <CodesignProvision>MyMauiApp</CodesignProvision>
  <CodesignEntitlements>Platforms\MacCatalyst\Entitlements.plist</CodesignEntitlements>
  <PackageSigningKey>3rd Party Mac Developer Installer: John Smith (AY2GDE9QM7)</PackageSigningKey>
</PropertyGroup>
```

[!INCLUDE [Publishing based on a property group](../includes/publishing-property-group.md)]

## Upload to the Mac App Store

Once an app was been code signed with an Apple Distribution certificate, it can't be run locally. Instead, it should be uploaded to App Store Connect where it will be re-signed to enable local execution.

To distribute your app through the Mac App Store, or TestFlight, you'll need to create an app record in App Store Connect. This record includes all the information about the app as it will appear in the App Store and all of the information needed to manage the app throughout the distribution process. For more information, see [Create an app record](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-a-new-app) on developer.apple.com.

[Transporter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/transporter/id1450874784?mt=12) can be used to submit your app to the Mac App Store. It will also help to identify errors with app packages that stop successful submission.
