# Linking a .NET MAUI Mac Catalyst app

[!INCLUDE [Linker introduction and behavior](../macios/includes/linker-behavior.md)]

To configure linker behavior in Visual Studio Code you should add the `$(MtouchLink)` build property to a property group in your app's *.csproj* file. This build property should be set to `None`, `SdkOnly`, or `Full`:

```xml
<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(TargetFramework)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|net8.0-maccatalyst|AnyCPU'">
  <MtouchLink>SdkOnly</MtouchLink>
</PropertyGroup>
```

Alternatively, you can specify the linker behavior via the CLI when building and publishing your app. For more information, see [Publish a .NET MAUI Mac Catalyst app](~/mac-catalyst/deployment/index.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `$(MtouchLink)` build property can be set separately for each build configuration for your app.

[!INCLUDE [Control the linker](../includes/linker-control.md)]
