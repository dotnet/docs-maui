# TabbedPage

:::image type="content" source="media/tabbedpage/pages.png" alt-text=".NET MAUI TabbedPage." border="false":::

The .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) `TabbedPage` maintains a collection of children of type `Page`, only one of which is fully visible at a time. Each child is identified by a series of tabs across the top or bottom of the page. Typically, each child will be a `ContentPage` and when its tab is selected the page content is displayed.

[!INCLUDE [docs under construction](~/includes/preview-note.md)]

`TabbedPage` defines the following properties:

- `BarBackground`, of type `Brush`, defines the background of the tab bar.
- `BarBackgroundColor`, of type `Color`, defines the background color of the tab bar.
- `BarTextColor`, of type `Color`, represents the color of the text on the tab bar.
- `SelectedTabColor`, of type `Color`, indicates the color of a tab when it's selected.
- `UnselectedTabColor`, of type `Color`, represents the color of a tab when it's unselected.

These properties are backed by `BindableProperty` objects, which means that they can be targets of data bindings, and styled.

> [!WARNING]
> In a `TabbedPage`, each `Page` object is created when the `TabbedPage` is constructed. This can lead to a poor user experience, particularly if the `TabbedPage` is the root page of your app. However, .NET MAUI Shell enables pages accessed through a tab bar to be created on demand, in response to navigation. `TabbedPage` should not be used in .NET MAUI Shell apps. For more information, see [.NET MAUI Shell](~/fundamentals/shell/index.md).

## Create a TabbedPage

Two approaches can be used to create a `TabbedPage`:

- Populate the `TabbedPage` with a collection of child `Page` objects, such as a collection of `ContentPage` objects. For more information, see [Populate a TabbedPage with a Page collection](#populate-a-tabbedpage-with-a-page-collection).
- Assign a collection to the `ItemsSource` property and assign a `DataTemplate` to the `ItemTemplate` property to return pages for objects in the collection. For more information, see [Populate a TabbedPage with a DataTemplate](#populate-a-tabbedpage-with-a-datatemplate).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A `TabbedPage` should only be populated with `NavigationPage` and `ContentPage` objects.

Regardless of the approach taken, the location of the tab bar in a `TabbedPage` is platform-dependent:

- On iOS, the list of tabs appears at the bottom of the screen, and the page content is above. Each tab consists of a title and an icon. In portrait orientation, tab bar icons appear above tab titles. In landscape orientation, icons and titles appear side by side. In addition, a regular or compact tab bar may be displayed, depending on the device and orientation. If there are more than five tabs, a **More** tab will appear, which can be used to access the additional tabs.
- On Android, the list of tabs appears at the top of the screen, and the page content is below. Each tab consists of a title and an icon. However, the tabs can be moved to the bottom of the screen with a platform-specific. If there are more than five tabs, and the tab list is at the bottom of the screen, a *More* tab will appear that can be used to access the additional tabs. <!--For information about moving the tabs to the bottom of the screen, see [Setting TabbedPage Toolbar Placement and Color](~/platform-integration/android/tabbedpage-toolbar-placement-color.md).-->
- On Windows, the list of tabs appears at the top of the screen, and the page content is below. Each tab consists of a title. However, icons can be added to each tab with a platform-specific. <!--For more information, see [TabbedPage Icons on Windows](~/platform/windows/tabbedpage-icons.md).-->

### Populate a TabbedPage with a Page collection

A `TabbedPage` can be populated with a collection of child `Page` objects, which will typically be `ContentPage` objects. This is achieved by adding `ContentPage` objects as children of the `TabbedPage`:

```xaml
<TabbedPage xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"
            xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
            xmlns:local="clr-namespace:TabbedPageWithNavigationPage"
            x:Class="TabbedPageWithNavigationPage.MainPage">
    <local:TodayPage />
    <local:SchedulePage />
    <local:SettingsPage />
</TabbedPage>
```

`Page` objects that are added as child elements of `TabbedPage` are added to the `Children` collection. The `Children` property of the `MultiPage<T>` class, from which `TabbedPage` derives, is the `ContentProperty` of `MultiPage<T>`. Therefore, in XAML it's not necessary to explicitly assign the `Page` objects to the `Children` property.

The following screenshot shows the appearance of the resulting tab bar on the `TabbedPage`:

The page content for a tab appears when the tab is selected.

### Populate a TabbedPage with a DataTemplate

`TabbedPage` inherits `ItemsSource`, `ItemTemplate`, and `SelectedItem` bindable properties from the `MultiPage<T>` class. These properties enable you to generate `TabbedPage` children dynamically, by setting the `ItemsSource` property to an `IEnumerable` collection of objects with public properties suitable for data bindings, and by setting the `ItemTemplate` property to a `DataTemplate` with a page type as the root element.

The following example shows generating `TabbedPage` children dynamically:

```xaml
<TabbedPage xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"
            xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
            xmlns:local="clr-namespace:TabbedPageDemo"
            x:Class="TabbedPageDemo.MainPage"
            ItemsSource="{x:Static local:MonkeyDataModel.All}">
    <TabbedPage.ItemTemplate>
        <DataTemplate>
            <ContentPage Title="{Binding Name}"
                         IconImageSource="monkeyicon.png">
                <StackLayout Padding="5, 25">
                    <Label Text="{Binding Name}"
                           FontAttributes="Bold"
                           FontSize="18"
                           HorizontalOptions="Center" />
                    <Image Source="{Binding PhotoUrl}"
                           HorizontalOptions="Center"
                           WidthRequest="200"
                           HeightRequest="200" />
                    <StackLayout Padding="50, 10">
                        <StackLayout Orientation="Horizontal">
                            <Label Text="Family: "
                                   FontAttributes="Bold" />
                            <Label Text="{Binding Family}" />
                        </StackLayout>
                        ...
                    </StackLayout>
                </StackLayout>
            </ContentPage>
        </DataTemplate>
    </TabbedPage.ItemTemplate>
</TabbedPage>
```

In this example, each tab consists of a `ContentPage` object that uses `Image` and `Label` objects to display data for the tab:

:::image type="content" source="media/tabbedpage/tabbedpage.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a .NET MAUI TabbedPage.":::

## Navigate within a tab

Navigation can be performed within a tab, provided that the `ContentPage` object is wrapped in a `NavigationPage` object:

```xaml
<TabbedPage xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"
            xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
            xmlns:local="clr-namespace:TabbedPageWithNavigationPage"
            x:Class="TabbedPageWithNavigationPage.MainPage">
    <local:TodayPage />
    <NavigationPage Title="Schedule"
                    IconImageSource="schedule.png">
        <x:Arguments>
            <local:SchedulePage />
        </x:Arguments>
    </NavigationPage>
</TabbedPage>
```

In this example, the `TabbedPage` is populated with two `Page` objects. The first child is a `ContentPage` object, and the second child is a `NavigationPage` object containing a `ContentPage` object.

When a `ContentPage` is wrapped in a `NavigationPage`, forwards page navigation can be performed by calling the `PushAsync` method on the `Navigation` property of the `ContentPage` object:

```csharp
await Navigation.PushAsync(new UpcomingAppointmentsPage());
```

For more information about performing navigation using the `NavigationPage` class, see [NavigationPage](navigationpage.md).

> [!WARNING]
> While a `NavigationPage` can be placed in a  `TabbedPage`, it's not recommended to place a `TabbedPage` into a `NavigationPage`.
