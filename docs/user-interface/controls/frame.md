# Frame

The .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) `Frame` class is used to wrap a view or layout with a border that can be configured with color, shadow, and other options. Frames can be used to create borders around controls but can also be used to create more complex UI.

[!INCLUDE [docs under construction](~/includes/preview-note.md)]

The `Frame` class defines the following properties:

- `BorderColor`, of type `Color`, determines the color of the `Frame` border.
- `CornerRadius`, of type `float`, determines the rounded radius of the corner.
- `HasShadow`, of type `bool`, determines whether the frame has a drop shadow.

These properties are backed by `BindableProperty` objects, which means that they can be targets of data bindings, and styled.

The `Frame` class inherits from `ContentView`, which provides a `Content` bindable property. The `Content` property is the `ContentProperty` of the `Frame` class, and therefore does not need to be explicitly set from XAML.

## Create a Frame

A `Frame` object typically wraps another control, such as a `Label`:

```xaml
<Frame>
  <Label Text="Frame wrapped around a Label" />
</Frame>
```

The appearance of `Frame` objects can be customized by setting properties:

```xaml
<Frame BorderColor="Gray"
       CornerRadius="10">
  <Label Text="Frame wrapped around a Label" />
</Frame>
```

The equivalent C# code is:

```csharp
Frame frame = new Frame
{
    BorderColor = Colors.Gray
    CornerRadius = 10,
    Content = new Label { Text = "Frame wrapped around a Label" }
};
```

## Create a card with a Frame

Combining a `Frame` object with a layout such as a `StackLayout` enables the creation of more complex UI.

The following XAML shows how to create a card with a `Frame`:

```xaml
<Frame BorderColor="Gray"
       CornerRadius="5"
       Padding="8">
  <StackLayout>
    <Label Text="Card Example"
           FontSize="Medium"
           FontAttributes="Bold" />
    <BoxView Color="Gray"
             HeightRequest="2"
             HorizontalOptions="Fill" />
    <Label Text="Frames can wrap more complex layouts to create more complex UI components, such as this card!"/>
  </StackLayout>
</Frame>
```

The following screenshot shows the example card:

## Round elements

The `CornerRadius` property of the `Frame` control is one approach to creating a circle image. The following XAML shows how to create a circle image with a `Frame`:

```xaml
<Frame Margin="10"
       BorderColor="Black"
       CornerRadius="50"
       HeightRequest="60"
       WidthRequest="60"
       IsClippedToBounds="True"
       HorizontalOptions="Center"
       VerticalOptions="Center">
  <Image Source="outdoors.jpg"
         Aspect="AspectFill"
         Margin="-20"
         HeightRequest="100"
         WidthRequest="100" />
</Frame>
```
