# ActivityIndicator

The .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ActivityIndicator> displays an animation to show that the application is engaged in a lengthy activity. Unlike <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ProgressBar>, <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ActivityIndicator> gives no indication of progress.

The appearance of an <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ActivityIndicator> is platform-dependent, and the following screenshot shows an <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ActivityIndicator> on Android:

<xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ActivityIndicator> defines the following properties:

- `Color` is a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Graphics.Color> value that defines the color of the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ActivityIndicator>.
- `IsRunning` is a `bool` value that indicates whether the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ActivityIndicator> should be visible and animating, or hidden. The default value of this property is `false`, which indicates that the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ActivityIndicator> isn't visible.

These properties are backed by <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.BindableProperty> objects, which means that they can be targets of data bindings, and styled.

## Create an ActivityIndicator

To indicate a lengthy activity, create an <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ActivityIndicator> object and sets its properties to define its appearance.

The following XAML example shows how to display an <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ActivityIndicator>:

```xaml
<ActivityIndicator IsRunning="true" />
```

The equivalent C# code is:

```csharp
ActivityIndicator activityIndicator = new ActivityIndicator { IsRunning = true };
```

The following XAML example shows how to change the color of an <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ActivityIndicator>:

```xaml
<ActivityIndicator IsRunning="true"
                   Color="Orange" />
```

The equivalent C# code is:

```csharp
ActivityIndicator activityIndicator = new ActivityIndicator
{
    IsRunning = true,
    Color = Colors.Orange
};
```
