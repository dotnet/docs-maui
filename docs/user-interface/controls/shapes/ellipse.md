# Ellipse

The .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) `Ellipse` class derives from the `Shape` class, and can be used to draw ellipses and circles. For information on the properties that the `Ellipse` class inherits from the `Shape` class, see [Shapes](index.md).

[!INCLUDE [docs under construction](~/includes/preview-note.md)]

The `Ellipse` class sets the `Aspect` property, inherited from the `Shape` class, to `Stretch.Fill`. For more information about the `Aspect` property, see [Stretch shapes](index.md#stretch-shapes).

## Create an Ellipse

To draw an ellipse, create an `Ellipse` object and set its `WidthRequest` and `HeightRequest` properties. To paint the inside of the ellipse, set its `Fill` property to a `Brush`-derived object. To give the ellipse an outline, set its `Stroke` property to a `Brush`-derived object. The `StrokeThickness` property specifies the thickness of the ellipse outline. For more information about `Brush` objects, see [Brushes](~/user-interface/brushes/index.md).

To draw a circle, make the `WidthRequest` and `HeightRequest` properties of the `Ellipse` object equal.

The following XAML example shows how to draw a filled ellipse:

```xaml
<Ellipse Fill="Red"
         WidthRequest="150"
         HeightRequest="50"
         HorizontalOptions="Start" />
```

In this example, a red filled ellipse with dimensions 150x50 (device-independent units) is drawn:

:::image type="content" source="media/ellipse/filled.png" alt-text="Filled ellipse.":::

The following XAML example shows how to draw a circle:

```xaml
<Ellipse Stroke="Red"
         StrokeThickness="4"
         WidthRequest="150"
         HeightRequest="150"
         HorizontalOptions="Start" />
```

In this example, a red circle with dimensions 150x150 (device-independent units) is drawn:

:::image type="content" source="media/ellipse/circle.png" alt-text="Unfilled circle.":::

For information about drawing a dashed ellipse, see [Draw dashed shapes](index.md#draw-dashed-shapes).
