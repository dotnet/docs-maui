# Configure CollectionView item selection

[![Browse sample.](~/media/code-sample.png) Browse the sample](/samples/dotnet/maui-samples/userinterface-collectionview)

The .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> defines the following properties that control item selection:

- `SelectionMode`, of type `SelectionMode`, the selection mode.
- `SelectedItem`, of type `object`, the selected item in the list. This property has a default binding mode of `TwoWay`, and has a `null` value when no item is selected.
- `SelectedItems`, of type `IList<object>`, the selected items in the list. This property has a default binding mode of `OneWay`, and has a `null` value when no items are selected.
- `SelectionChangedCommand`, of type `ICommand`, which is executed when the selected item changes.
- `SelectionChangedCommandParameter`, of type `object`, which is the parameter that's passed to the `SelectionChangedCommand`.

All of these properties are backed by <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.BindableProperty> objects, which means that the properties can be targets of data bindings.

By default, <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> selection is disabled. However, this behavior can be changed by setting the `SelectionMode` property value to one of the `SelectionMode` enumeration members:

- `None` – indicates that items can't be selected. This is the default value.
- `Single` – indicates that a single item can be selected, with the selected item being highlighted.
- `Multiple` – indicates that multiple items can be selected, with the selected items being highlighted.

<xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> defines a `SelectionChanged` event that is fired when the `SelectedItem` property changes, either due to the user selecting an item from the list, or when an application sets the property. In addition, this event is also fired when the `SelectedItems` property changes. The `SelectionChangedEventArgs` object that accompanies the `SelectionChanged` event has two properties, both of type `IReadOnlyList<object>`:

- `PreviousSelection` – the list of items that were selected, before the selection changed.
- `CurrentSelection` – the list of items that are selected, after the selection change.

In addition, <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> has a `UpdateSelectedItems` method that updates the `SelectedItems` property with a list of selected items, while only firing a single change notification.

## Single selection

When the `SelectionMode` property is set to `Single`, a single item in the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> can be selected. When an item is selected, the `SelectedItem` property is set to the value of the selected item. When this property changes, the `SelectionChangedCommand` is executed (with the value of the `SelectionChangedCommandParameter` being passed to the `ICommand`), and the `SelectionChanged` event fires.

The following XAML example shows a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> that can respond to single item selection:

```xaml
<CollectionView ItemsSource="{Binding Monkeys}"
                SelectionMode="Single"
                SelectionChanged="OnCollectionViewSelectionChanged">
    ...
</CollectionView>
```

The equivalent C# code is:

```csharp
CollectionView collectionView = new CollectionView
{
    SelectionMode = SelectionMode.Single
};
collectionView.SetBinding(ItemsView.ItemsSourceProperty, "Monkeys");
collectionView.SelectionChanged += OnCollectionViewSelectionChanged;
```

In this code example, the `OnCollectionViewSelectionChanged` event handler is executed when the `SelectionChanged` event fires, with the event handler retrieving the previously selected item, and the current selected item:

```csharp
void OnCollectionViewSelectionChanged(object sender, SelectionChangedEventArgs e)
{
    string previous = (e.PreviousSelection.FirstOrDefault() as Monkey)?.Name;
    string current = (e.CurrentSelection.FirstOrDefault() as Monkey)?.Name;
    ...
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `SelectionChanged` event can be fired by changes that occur as a result of changing the `SelectionMode` property.

The following screenshot shows single item selection in a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView>:

## Multiple selection

When the `SelectionMode` property is set to `Multiple`, multiple items in the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> can be selected. When items are selected, the `SelectedItems` property is set to the selected items. When this property changes, the `SelectionChangedCommand` is executed (with the value of the `SelectionChangedCommandParameter` being passed to the `ICommand`, and the `SelectionChanged` event fires.

The following XAML example shows a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> that can respond to multiple item selection:

```xaml
<CollectionView ItemsSource="{Binding Monkeys}"
                SelectionMode="Multiple"
                SelectionChanged="OnCollectionViewSelectionChanged">
    ...
</CollectionView>
```

The equivalent C# code is:

```csharp
CollectionView collectionView = new CollectionView
{
    SelectionMode = SelectionMode.Multiple
};
collectionView.SetBinding(ItemsView.ItemsSourceProperty, "Monkeys");
collectionView.SelectionChanged += OnCollectionViewSelectionChanged;
```

In this code example, the `OnCollectionViewSelectionChanged` event handler is executed when the `SelectionChanged` event fires, with the event handler retrieving the previously selected items, and the current selected items:

```csharp
void OnCollectionViewSelectionChanged(object sender, SelectionChangedEventArgs e)
{
    var previous = e.PreviousSelection;
    var current = e.CurrentSelection;
    ...
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `SelectionChanged` event can be fired by changes that occur as a result of changing the `SelectionMode` property.

The following screenshot shows multiple item selection in a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView>:

:::image type="content" source="media/selection/multiple-selection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a CollectionView vertical list with multiple selection.":::

## Single preselection

When the `SelectionMode` property is set to `Single`, a single item in the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> can be preselected by setting the `SelectedItem` property to the item. The following XAML example shows a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> that preselects a single item:

```xaml
<CollectionView ItemsSource="{Binding Monkeys}"
                SelectionMode="Single"
                SelectedItem="{Binding SelectedMonkey}">
    ...
</CollectionView>
```

The equivalent C# code is:

```csharp
CollectionView collectionView = new CollectionView
{
    SelectionMode = SelectionMode.Single
};
collectionView.SetBinding(ItemsView.ItemsSourceProperty, "Monkeys");
collectionView.SetBinding(SelectableItemsView.SelectedItemProperty, "SelectedMonkey");
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `SelectedItem` property has a default binding mode of `TwoWay`.

The `SelectedItem` property data binds to the `SelectedMonkey` property of the connected view model, which is of type `Monkey`. By default, a `TwoWay` binding is used so that if the user changes the selected item, the value of the `SelectedMonkey` property is set to the selected `Monkey` object. The `SelectedMonkey` property is defined in the `MonkeysViewModel` class, and is set to the fourth item of the `Monkeys` collection:

```csharp
public class MonkeysViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    ...
    public ObservableCollection<Monkey> Monkeys { get; private set; }

    Monkey selectedMonkey;
    public Monkey SelectedMonkey
    {
        get
        {
            return selectedMonkey;
        }
        set
        {
            if (selectedMonkey != value)
            {
                selectedMonkey = value;
            }
        }
    }

    public MonkeysViewModel()
    {
        ...
        selectedMonkey = Monkeys.Skip(3).FirstOrDefault();
    }
    ...
}
```

Therefore, when the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> appears, the fourth item in the list is preselected:

:::image type="content" source="media/selection/single-pre-selection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a CollectionView vertical list with single preselection.":::

## Multiple preselection

When the `SelectionMode` property is set to `Multiple`, multiple items in the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> can be preselected. The following XAML example shows a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> that enables the preselection of multiple items:

```xaml
<CollectionView x:Name="collectionView"
                ItemsSource="{Binding Monkeys}"
                SelectionMode="Multiple"
                SelectedItems="{Binding SelectedMonkeys}">
    ...
</CollectionView>
```

The equivalent C# code is:

```csharp
CollectionView collectionView = new CollectionView
{
    SelectionMode = SelectionMode.Multiple
};
collectionView.SetBinding(ItemsView.ItemsSourceProperty, "Monkeys");
collectionView.SetBinding(SelectableItemsView.SelectedItemsProperty, "SelectedMonkeys");
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `SelectedItems` property has a default binding mode of `OneWay`.

The `SelectedItems` property data binds to the `SelectedMonkeys` property of the connected view model, which is of type `ObservableCollection<object>`. The `SelectedMonkeys` property is defined in the `MonkeysViewModel` class, and is set to the second, fourth, and fifth items in the `Monkeys` collection:

```csharp
namespace CollectionViewDemos.ViewModels
{
    public class MonkeysViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
    {
        ...
        ObservableCollection<object> selectedMonkeys;
        public ObservableCollection<object> SelectedMonkeys
        {
            get
            {
                return selectedMonkeys;
            }
            set
            {
                if (selectedMonkeys != value)
                {
                    selectedMonkeys = value;
                }
            }
        }

        public MonkeysViewModel()
        {
            ...
            SelectedMonkeys = new ObservableCollection<object>()
            {
                Monkeys[1], Monkeys[3], Monkeys[4]
            };
        }
        ...
    }
}
```

Therefore, when the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> appears, the second, fourth, and fifth items in the list are preselected:

:::image type="content" source="media/selection/multiple-pre-selection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a CollectionView vertical list with multiple preselection.":::

## Clear selections

The `SelectedItem` and `SelectedItems` properties can be cleared by setting them, or the objects they bind to, to `null`. When either of these properties are cleared, the `SelectionChanged` event is raised with an empty `CurrentSelection` property, and the `SelectionChangedCommand` is executed.

## Change selected item color

<xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> has a `Selected` <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.VisualState> that can be used to initiate a visual change to the selected item in the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView>. A common use case for this <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.VisualState> is to change the background color of the selected item, which is shown in the following XAML example:

```xaml
<ContentPage ...>
    <ContentPage.Resources>
        <Style TargetType="Grid">
            <Setter Property="VisualStateManager.VisualStateGroups">
                <VisualStateGroupList>
                    <VisualStateGroup x:Name="CommonStates">
                        <VisualState x:Name="Normal" />
                        <VisualState x:Name="Selected">
                            <VisualState.Setters>
                                <Setter Property="BackgroundColor"
                                        Value="LightSkyBlue" />
                            </VisualState.Setters>
                        </VisualState>
                    </VisualStateGroup>
                </VisualStateGroupList>
            </Setter>
        </Style>
    </ContentPage.Resources>
    <Grid Margin="20">
        <CollectionView ItemsSource="{Binding Monkeys}"
                        SelectionMode="Single">
            <CollectionView.ItemTemplate>
                <DataTemplate>
                    <Grid Padding="10">
                        ...
                    </Grid>
                </DataTemplate>
            </CollectionView.ItemTemplate>
        </CollectionView>
    </Grid>
</ContentPage>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Style> that contains the `Selected` <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.VisualState> must have a `TargetType` property value that's the type of the root element of the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.DataTemplate>, which is set as the `ItemTemplate` property value.

The equivalent C# code for the style containing the visual state is:

```csharp
using static Microsoft.Maui.Controls.VisualStateManager;
...

Setter backgroundColorSetter = new() { Property = BackgroundColorProperty, Value = Colors.LightSkyBlue };
VisualState stateSelected = new() { Name = CommonStates.Selected, Setters = { backgroundColorSetter } };
VisualState stateNormal = new() { Name = CommonStates.Normal };
VisualStateGroup visualStateGroup = new() { Name = nameof(CommonStates), States = { stateSelected, stateNormal } };
VisualStateGroupList visualStateGroupList = new() { visualStateGroup };
Setter vsgSetter = new() { Property = VisualStateGroupsProperty, Value = visualStateGroupList };
Style style = new(typeof(Grid)) { Setters = { vsgSetter } };

// Add the style to the resource dictionary
Resources.Add(style);
```

In this example, the `Style.TargetType` property value is set to <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Grid> because the root element of the `ItemTemplate` is a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Grid>. The `Selected` <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.VisualState> specifies that when an item in the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> is selected, the `BackgroundColor` of the item is set to `LightSkyBlue`:

:::image type="content" source="media/selection/single-selection-color.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a CollectionView vertical list with a custom single selection color.":::

For more information about visual states, see [Visual states](~/user-interface/visual-states.md).

## Disable selection

<xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> selection is disabled by default. However, if a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> has selection enabled, it can be disabled by setting the `SelectionMode` property to `None`:

```xaml
<CollectionView ...
                SelectionMode="None" />
```

The equivalent C# code is:

```csharp
CollectionView collectionView = new CollectionView
{
    ...
    SelectionMode = SelectionMode.None
};
```

When the `SelectionMode` property is set to `None`, items in the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> can't be selected, the `SelectedItem` property remains `null`, and the `SelectionChanged` event isn't fired.

> [!NOTE]
> When an item has been selected and the `SelectionMode` property is changed from `Single` to `None`, the `SelectedItem` property will be set to `null` and the `SelectionChanged` event will be fired with an empty `CurrentSelection` property.
