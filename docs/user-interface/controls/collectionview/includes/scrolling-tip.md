> [!TIP]
> Placing a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> inside a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.VerticalStackLayout> can stop the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.CollectionView> scrolling, and can limit the number of items that are displayed. In this situation, replace the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.VerticalStackLayout> with a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Grid>.
