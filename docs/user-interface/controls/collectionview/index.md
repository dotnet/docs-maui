# CollectionView

The .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) `CollectionView` is a view for presenting lists of data using different layout specifications. It aims to provide a more flexible, and performant alternative to `ListView`.

[!INCLUDE [docs under construction](~/includes/preview-note.md)]

The following screenshot shows a `CollectionView` that uses a two column vertical grid, and which allows multiple selection:

`CollectionView` should be used for presenting lists of data that require scrolling or selection. A bindable layout can be used when the data to be displayed doesn't require scrolling or selection. <!-- For more information, see [BindableLayout](~/user-interface/controls/layouts/bindablelayout.md). -->

## CollectionView and ListView differences

While the `CollectionView` and `ListView` APIs are similar, there are some notable differences:

- `CollectionView` has a flexible layout model, which allows data to be presented vertically or horizontally, in a list or a grid.
- `CollectionView` supports single and multiple selection.
- `CollectionView` has no concept of cells. Instead, a data template is used to define the appearance of each item of data in the list.
- `CollectionView` automatically utilizes the virtualization provided by the underlying native controls.
- `CollectionView` reduces the API surface of `ListView`. Many properties and events from `ListView` are not present in `CollectionView`.
- `CollectionView` does not include built-in separators.
- `CollectionView` will throw an exception if its `ItemsSource` is updated off the UI thread.

## Move from ListView to CollectionView

`ListView` implementations can be migrated to `CollectionView` implementations with the help of the following table:

| Concept | ListView API | CollectionView |
|---|---|---|
| Data | `ItemsSource` | A `CollectionView` is populated with data by setting its `ItemsSource` property. For more information, see [Populate a CollectionView with data](populate-data.md#populate-a-collectionview-with-data). |
| Item appearance | `ItemTemplate` | The appearance of each item in a `CollectionView` can be defined by setting the `ItemTemplate` property to a `DataTemplate`. For more information, see [Define item appearance](populate-data.md#define-item-appearance). |
| Cells | `TextCell`, `ImageCell`, `ViewCell` | `CollectionView` has no concept of cells, and therefore no concept of disclosure indicators. Instead, a data template is used to define the appearance of each item of data in the list. |
| Row separators | `SeparatorColor`, `SeparatorVisibility` | `CollectionView` does not include built-in separators. These can be provided, if desired, in the item template. |
| Selection | `SelectionMode`, `SelectedItem` | `CollectionView` supports single and multiple selection. For more information, see [Configure CollectionView item selection](selection.md). |
| Row height | `HasUnevenRows`, `RowHeight` | In a `CollectionView`, the row height of each item is determined by the `ItemSizingStrategy` property. For more information, see [Item sizing](layout.md#item-sizing).|
| Caching | `CachingStrategy` | `CollectionView` automatically uses the virtualization provided by the underlying native controls. |
| Headers and footers | `Header`, `HeaderElement`, `HeaderTemplate`, `Footer`, `FooterElement`, `FooterTemplate` | `CollectionView` can present a header and footer that scroll with the items in the list, via the `Header`, `Footer`, `HeaderTemplate`, and `FooterTemplate` properties. For more information, see [Headers and footers](layout.md#headers-and-footers). |
| Grouping | `GroupDisplayBinding`, `GroupHeaderTemplate`, `GroupShortNameBinding`, `IsGroupingEnabled` | `CollectionView` displays correctly grouped data by setting its `IsGrouped` property to `true`. Group headers and group footers can be customized by setting the `GroupHeaderTemplate` and `GroupFooterTemplate` properties to  `DataTemplate` objects. For more information, see [Display grouped data in a CollectionView](grouping.md). |
| Pull to refresh | `IsPullToRefreshEnabled`, `IsRefreshing`, `RefreshAllowed`, `RefreshCommand`, `RefreshControlColor`, `BeginRefresh()`, `EndRefresh()` | Pull to refresh functionality is supported by setting a `CollectionView` as the child of a `RefreshView`. For more information, see [Pull to refresh](populate-data.md#pull-to-refresh). |
| Context menu items | `ContextActions` | Context menu items are supported by setting a `SwipeView` as the root view in the `DataTemplate` that defines the appearance of each item of data in the `CollectionView`. For more information, see [Context menus](populate-data.md#context-menus). |
| Scrolling | `ScrollTo()` | `CollectionView` defines `ScrollTo` methods, that scroll items into view. For more information, see [Control scrolling in a CollectionView](scrolling.md). |
