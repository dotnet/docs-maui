# Editor

The .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Editor> allows you to enter and edit multiple lines of text.

<xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Editor> defines the following properties:

- `AutoSize`, of type `EditorAutoSizeOption`, defines whether the editor will change size to accommodate user input. By default, the editor doesn't auto size.
- `HorizontalTextAlignment`, of type `TextAlignment`, defines the horizontal alignment of the text.
- `VerticalTextAlignment`, of type `TextAlignment`, defines the vertical alignment of the text.

These properties are backed by <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.BindableProperty> objects, which means that they can be targets of data bindings, and styled.

In addition, <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Editor> defines a `Completed` event, which is raised when the user finalizes text in the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Editor> with the return key.

<xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Editor> derives from the `InputView` class, from which it inherits the following properties:

- `CharacterSpacing`, of type `double`, sets the spacing between characters in the entered text.
- `CursorPosition`, of type `int`, defines the position of the cursor within the editor.
- `FontAttributes`, of type `FontAttributes`, determines text style.
- `FontAutoScalingEnabled`, of type `bool`, defines whether the text will reflect scaling preferences set in the operating system. The default value of this property is `true`.
- `FontFamily`, of type `string`, defines the font family.
- `FontSize`, of type `double`, defines the font size.
- `IsReadOnly`, of type `bool`, defines whether the user should be prevented from modifying text. The default value of this property is `false`.
- `IsSpellCheckEnabled`, of type `bool`, controls whether spell checking is enabled.
- `IsTextPredictionEnabled`, of type `bool`, controls whether text prediction and automatic text correction is enabled.
- `Keyboard`, of type `Keyboard`, specifies the soft input keyboard that's displayed when entering text.
- `MaxLength`, of type `int`, defines the maximum input length.
- `Placeholder`, of type `string`, defines the text that's displayed when the control is empty.
- `PlaceholderColor`, of type <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Graphics.Color>, defines the color of the placeholder text.
- `SelectionLength`, of type `int`, represents the length of selected text within the control.
- `Text`, of type `string`, defines the text entered into the control.
- `TextColor`, of type <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Graphics.Color>, defines the color of the entered text.
- `TextTransform`, of type `TextTransform`, specifies the casing of the entered text.

These properties are backed by <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.BindableProperty> objects, which means that they can be targets of data bindings, and styled.

In addition, `InputView` defines a `TextChanged` event, which is raised when the text in the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Editor> changes. The `TextChangedEventArgs` object that accompanies the `TextChanged` event has `NewTextValue` and `OldTextValue` properties, which specify the new and old text, respectively.

For information about specifying fonts on an <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Editor>, see [Fonts](~/user-interface/fonts.md).

## Create an Editor

The following example shows how to create an <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Editor>:

```xaml
<Editor x:Name="editor"
        Placeholder="Enter your response here"
        HeightRequest="250"
        TextChanged="OnEditorTextChanged"
        Completed="OnEditorCompleted" />
```

The equivalent C# code is:

```csharp
Editor editor = new Editor { Placeholder = "Enter text", HeightRequest = 250 };
editor.TextChanged += OnEditorTextChanged;
editor.Completed += OnEditorCompleted;
```

The following screenshot shows the resulting <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Editor> on Android:

:::image type="content" source="media/editor/editor.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a basic Editor on Android.":::

[!INCLUDE [Keyboard autoscroll manager](includes/keyboardautomanagerscroll.md)]

Entered text can be accessed by reading the `Text` property, and the `TextChanged` and `Completed` events signal that the text has changed or been completed.

The `TextChanged` event is raised when the text in the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Editor> changes, and the `TextChangedEventArgs` provide the text before and after the change via the `OldTextValue` and `NewTextValue` properties:

```csharp
void OnEditorTextChanged(object sender, TextChangedEventArgs e)
{
    string oldText = e.OldTextValue;
    string newText = e.NewTextValue;
    string myText = editor.Text;
}
```

The `Completed` event is only raised on Windows when the user has ended input by pressing the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key on the keyboard, or by focusing another control. The handler for the event is a generic event handler:

```csharp
void OnEditorCompleted(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
   string text = ((Editor)sender).Text;
}
```

## Set character spacing

Character spacing can be applied to an <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Editor> by setting the `CharacterSpacing` property to a `double` value:

```xaml
<Editor ...
        CharacterSpacing="10" />
```

The result is that characters in the text displayed by the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Editor> are spaced `CharacterSpacing` device-independent units apart.

> [!NOTE]
> The `CharacterSpacing` property value is applied to the text displayed by the `Text` and `Placeholder` properties.

## Limit input length

The `MaxLength` property can be used to limit the input length that's permitted for the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Editor>. This property should be set to a positive integer:

```xaml
<Editor ... MaxLength="10" />
```

A `MaxLength` property value of 0 indicates that no input will be allowed, and a value of `int.MaxValue`, which is the default value for an <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Editor>, indicates that there is no effective limit on the number of characters that may be entered.

## Auto-size an Editor

An <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Editor> can be made to auto-size to its content by setting the `Editor.AutoSize` property to `TextChanges`, which is a value of the `EditorAutoSizeOption` enumeration. This enumeration has two values:

- `Disabled` indicates that automatic resizing is disabled, and is the default value.
- `TextChanges` indicates that automatic resizing is enabled.

This can be accomplished as follows:

```xaml
<Editor Text="Enter text here"
        AutoSize="TextChanges" />
```

When auto-resizing is enabled, the height of the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Editor> will increase when the user fills it with text, and the height will decrease as the user deletes text.

> [!NOTE]
> An <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Editor> will not auto-size if the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.VisualElement.HeightRequest> property has been set.

## Transform text

An <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Editor> can transform the casing of its text, stored in the `Text` property, by setting the `TextTransform` property to a value of the `TextTransform` enumeration. This enumeration has four values:

- `None` indicates that the text won't be transformed.
- `Default` indicates that the default behavior for the platform will be used. This is the default value of the `TextTransform` property.
- `Lowercase` indicates that the text will be transformed to lowercase.
- `Uppercase` indicates that the text will be transformed to uppercase.

The following example shows transforming text to uppercase:

```xaml
<Editor Text="This text will be displayed in uppercase."
        TextTransform="Uppercase" />
```

## Customize the keyboard

The keyboard that's presented when users interact with an <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Editor> can be set programmatically via the `Keyboard` property, to one of the following properties from the `Keyboard` class:

- `Chat` – used for texting and places where emoji are useful.
- `Default` – the default keyboard.
- `Email` – used when entering email addresses.
- `Numeric` – used when entering numbers.
- `Plain` – used when entering text, without any `KeyboardFlags` specified.
- `Telephone` – used when entering telephone numbers.
- `Text` – used when entering text.
- `Url` – used for entering file paths & web addresses.

The following example shows setting the `Keyboard` property:

```xaml
<Editor Keyboard="Chat" />
```

The `Keyboard` class also has a `Create` factory method that can be used to customize a keyboard by specifying capitalization, spellcheck, and suggestion behavior. `KeyboardFlags` enumeration values are specified as arguments to the method, with a customized `Keyboard` being returned. The `KeyboardFlags` enumeration contains the following values:

- `None` – no features are added to the keyboard.
- `CapitalizeSentence` – indicates that the first letter of the first word of each entered sentence will be automatically capitalized.
- `Spellcheck` – indicates that spellcheck will be performed on entered text.
- `Suggestions` – indicates that word completions will be offered on entered text.
- `CapitalizeWord` – indicates that the first letter of each word will be automatically capitalized.
- `CapitalizeCharacter` – indicates that every character will be automatically capitalized.
- `CapitalizeNone` – indicates that no automatic capitalization will occur.
- `All` – indicates that spellcheck, word completions, and sentence capitalization will occur on entered text.

The following XAML code example shows how to customize the default `Keyboard` to offer word completions and capitalize every entered character:

```xaml
<Editor>
    <Editor.Keyboard>
        <Keyboard x:FactoryMethod="Create">
            <x:Arguments>
                <KeyboardFlags>Suggestions,CapitalizeCharacter</KeyboardFlags>
            </x:Arguments>
        </Keyboard>
    </Editor.Keyboard>
</Editor>
```

The equivalent C# code is:

```csharp
Editor editor = new Editor();
editor.Keyboard = Keyboard.Create(KeyboardFlags.Suggestions | KeyboardFlags.CapitalizeCharacter);
```

[!INCLUDE [Hide and show the soft input keyboard](includes/soft-input-extensions.md)]

The following example shows how to hide the soft input keyboard on an <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Editor> named `editor`, if it's currently showing:

```csharp
if (editor.IsSoftInputShowing())
    await editor.HideSoftInputAsync(System.Threading.CancellationToken.None);
```

## Enable and disable spell checking

The `IsSpellCheckEnabled` property controls whether spell checking is enabled. By default, the property is set to `true`. As the user enters text, misspellings are indicated.

However, for some text entry scenarios, such as entering a username, spell checking provides a negative experience and so should be disabled by setting the `IsSpellCheckEnabled` property to `false`:

```xaml
<Editor ... IsSpellCheckEnabled="false" />
```

> [!NOTE]
> When the `IsSpellCheckEnabled` property is set to `false`, and a custom keyboard isn't being used, the native spell checker will be disabled. However, if a `Keyboard` has been set that disables spell checking, such as `Keyboard.Chat`, the `IsSpellCheckEnabled` property is ignored. Therefore, the property cannot be used to enable spell checking for a `Keyboard` that explicitly disables it.

## Enable and disable text prediction

The `IsTextPredictionEnabled` property controls whether text prediction and automatic text correction is enabled. By default, the property is set to `true`. As the user enters text, word predictions are presented.

However, for some text entry scenarios, such as entering a username, text prediction and automatic text correction provides a negative experience and should be disabled by setting the `IsTextPredictionEnabled` property to `false`:

```xaml
<Editor ... IsTextPredictionEnabled="false" />
```

> [!NOTE]
> When the `IsTextPredictionEnabled` property is set to `false`, and a custom keyboard isn't being used, text prediction and automatic text correction is disabled. However, if a `Keyboard` has been set that disables text prediction, the `IsTextPredictionEnabled` property is ignored. Therefore, the property cannot be used to enable text prediction for a `Keyboard` that explicitly disables it.

## Prevent text entry

Users can be prevented from modifying the text in an <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Editor> by setting the `IsReadOnly` property, which has a default value of `false`, to `true`:

```xaml
<Editor Text="This is a read-only Editor"
        IsReadOnly="true" />
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `IsReadonly` property does not alter the visual appearance of an <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Editor>, unlike the `IsEnabled` property that also changes the visual appearance of the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Editor> to gray.
