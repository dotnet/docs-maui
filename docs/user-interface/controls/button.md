# Button

The .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> displays text and responds to a tap or click that directs the app to carry out a task. A <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> usually displays a short text string indicating a command, but it can also display a bitmap image, or a combination of text and an image. When the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> is pressed with a finger or clicked with a mouse it initiates that command.

<xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> defines the following properties:

- `BorderColor`, of type <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Graphics.Color>, describes the border color of the button.
- `BorderWidth`, of type `double`, defines the width of the button's border.
- `CharacterSpacing`, of type `double`, defines the spacing between characters of the button's text.
- `Command`, of type `ICommand`, defines the command that's executed when the button is tapped.
- `CommandParameter`, of type `object`, is the parameter that's passed to `Command`.
- `ContentLayout`, of type `ButtonContentLayout`, defines the object that controls the position of the button image and the spacing between the button's image and text.
- `CornerRadius`, of type `int`, describes the corner radius of the button's border.
- `FontAttributes`, of type `FontAttributes`, determines text style.
- `FontAutoScalingEnabled`, of type `bool`, defines whether the button text will reflect scaling preferences set in the operating system. The default value of this property is `true`.
- `FontFamily`, of type `string`, defines the font family.
- `FontSize`, of type `double`, defines the font size.
- <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ImageSource>, of type <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ImageSource>, specifies a bitmap image to display as the content of the button.
- `LineBreakMode`, of type `LineBreakMode`, determines how text should be handled when it can't fit on one line.
- `Padding`, of type `Thickness`, determines the button's padding.
- `Text`, of type `string`, defines the text displayed as the content of the button.
- `TextColor`, of type <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Graphics.Color>, describes the color of the button's text.
- `TextTransform`, of type `TextTransform`, defines the casing of the button's text.

These properties are backed by <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.BindableProperty> objects, which means that they can be targets of data bindings, and styled.

> [!NOTE]
> While <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> defines an <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ImageSource> property, that allows you to display a image on the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button>, this property is intended to be used when displaying a small icon next to the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> text.

In addition, <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> defines `Clicked`, `Pressed`, and `Released` events. The `Clicked` event is raised when a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> tap with a finger or mouse pointer is released from the button's surface. The `Pressed` event is raised when a finger presses on a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button>, or a mouse button is pressed with the pointer positioned over the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button>. The `Released` event is raised when the finger or mouse button is released. Generally, a `Clicked` event is also raised at the same time as the `Released` event, but if the finger or mouse pointer slides away from the surface of the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> before being released, the `Clicked` event might not occur.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> must have its `IsEnabled` property set to `true` for it to respond to taps.

## Create a Button

To create a button, create a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> object and handle its `Clicked` event.

The following XAML example show how to create a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button>:

```xaml
<ContentPage xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
             x:Class="ButtonDemos.BasicButtonClickPage"
             Title="Basic Button Click">
    <StackLayout>
        <Button Text="Click to Rotate Text!"
                VerticalOptions="Center"
                HorizontalOptions="Center"
                Clicked="OnButtonClicked" />
        <Label x:Name="label"
               Text="Click the Button above"
               FontSize="18"
               VerticalOptions="Center"
               HorizontalOptions="Center" />
    </StackLayout>
</ContentPage>
```

The `Text` property specifies the text that appears in the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button>. The `Clicked` event is set to an event handler named `OnButtonClicked`. This handler is located in the code-behind file:

```csharp
public partial class BasicButtonClickPage : ContentPage
{
    public BasicButtonClickPage ()
    {
        InitializeComponent ();
    }

    async void OnButtonClicked(object sender, EventArgs args)
    {
        await label.RelRotateTo(360, 1000);
    }
}
```

In this example, when the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> is tapped, the `OnButtonClicked` method executes. The `sender` argument is the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> object responsible for this event. You can use this to access the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> object, or to distinguish between multiple <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> objects sharing the same `Clicked` event. The `Clicked` handler calls an animation function that rotates the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Label> 360 degrees in 1000 milliseconds:

:::image type="content" source="media/button/button-rotation.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a Button.":::

The equivalent C# code to create a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> is:

```csharp
Button button = new Button
{
    Text = "Click to Rotate Text!",
    VerticalOptions = LayoutOptions.Center,
    HorizontalOptions = LayoutOptions.Center
};
button.Clicked += async (sender, args) => await label.RelRotateTo(360, 1000);
```

## Use the command interface

An app can respond to <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> taps without handling the `Clicked` event. The <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> implements an alternative notification mechanism called the _command_ or _commanding_ interface. This consists of two properties:

- `Command` of type [`ICommand`](xref:System.Windows.Input.ICommand), an interface defined in the [`System.Windows.Input`](xref:System.Windows.Input) namespace.
- `CommandParameter` property of type [`Object`](xref:System.Object).

This approach is particularly suitable in connection with data-binding, and particularly when implementing the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern. In an MVVM application, the viewmodel defines properties of type `ICommand` that are then connected to <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> objects with data bindings. .NET MAUI also defines `Command` and `Command<T>` classes that implement the `ICommand` interface and assist the viewmodel in defining properties of type `ICommand`. For more information about commanding, see [Commanding](~/fundamentals/data-binding/commanding.md).

The following example shows a very simple viewmodel class that defines a property of type `double` named `Number`, and two properties of type `ICommand` named `MultiplyBy2Command` and `DivideBy2Command`:

```csharp
public class CommandDemoViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    double number = 1;

    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;

    public ICommand MultiplyBy2Command { get; private set; }
    public ICommand DivideBy2Command { get; private set; }

    public CommandDemoViewModel()
    {
        MultiplyBy2Command = new Command(() => Number *= 2);
        DivideBy2Command = new Command(() => Number /= 2);
    }

    public double Number
    {
        get
        {
            return number;
        }
        set
        {
            if (number != value)
            {
                number = value;
                PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs("Number"));
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the two `ICommand` properties are initialized in the class's constructor with two objects of type `Command`. The `Command` constructors include a little function (called the `execute` constructor argument) that either doubles or halves the value of the `Number` property.

The following XAML example consumes the `CommandDemoViewModel` class:

```xaml
<ContentPage xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
             xmlns:local="clr-namespace:ButtonDemos"
             x:Class="ButtonDemos.BasicButtonCommandPage"
             Title="Basic Button Command">
    <ContentPage.BindingContext>
        <local:CommandDemoViewModel />
    </ContentPage.BindingContext>

    <StackLayout>
        <Label Text="{Binding Number, StringFormat='Value is now {0}'}"
               FontSize="18"
               VerticalOptions="Center"
               HorizontalOptions="Center" />
        <Button Text="Multiply by 2"
                VerticalOptions="Center"
                HorizontalOptions="Center"
                Command="{Binding MultiplyBy2Command}" />
        <Button Text="Divide by 2"
                VerticalOptions="Center"
                HorizontalOptions="Center"
                Command="{Binding DivideBy2Command}" />
    </StackLayout>
</ContentPage>
```

In this example, the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Label> element and two <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> objects contain bindings to the three properties in the `CommandDemoViewModel` class. As the two <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> objects are tapped, the commands are executed, and the number changes value. The advantage of this approach over `Clicked` handlers is that all the logic involving the functionality of this page is located in the viewmodel rather than the code-behind file, achieving a better separation of the user interface from the business logic.

It's also possible for the `Command` objects to control the enabling and disabling of the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> objects. For example, suppose you want to limit the range of number values between 2<sup>10</sup> and 2<sup>&ndash;10</sup>. You can add another function to the constructor (called the `canExecute` argument) that returns `true` if the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> should be enabled:

```csharp
public class CommandDemoViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    ···
    public CommandDemoViewModel()
    {
        MultiplyBy2Command = new Command(
            execute: () =>
            {
                Number *= 2;
                ((Command)MultiplyBy2Command).ChangeCanExecute();
                ((Command)DivideBy2Command).ChangeCanExecute();
            },
            canExecute: () => Number < Math.Pow(2, 10));

        DivideBy2Command = new Command(
            execute: () =>
            {
                Number /= 2;
                ((Command)MultiplyBy2Command).ChangeCanExecute();
                ((Command)DivideBy2Command).ChangeCanExecute();
            },
            canExecute: () => Number > Math.Pow(2, -10));
    }
    ···
}
```

In this example, the calls to the `ChangeCanExecute` method of `Command` are required so that the `Command` method can call the `canExecute` method and determine whether the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> should be disabled or not. With this code change, as the number reaches the limit, the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> is disabled.

It's also possible for two or more <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> elements to be bound to the same `ICommand` property. The <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> elements can be distinguished using the `CommandParameter` property of <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button>. In this case, you'll want to use the generic `Command<T>` class. The `CommandParameter` object is then passed as an argument to the `execute` and `canExecute` methods. For more information, see [Commanding](~/fundamentals/data-binding/commanding.md).

## Press and release the button

The `Pressed` event is raised when a finger presses on a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button>, or a mouse button is pressed with the pointer positioned over the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button>. The `Released` event is raised when the finger or mouse button is released. Generally, a `Clicked` event is also raised at the same time as the `Released` event, but if the finger or mouse pointer slides away from the surface of the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> before being released, the `Clicked` event might not occur.

The following XAML example shows a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Label> and a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> with handlers attached for the `Pressed` and `Released` events:

```xaml
<ContentPage xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
             x:Class="ButtonDemos.PressAndReleaseButtonPage"
             Title="Press and Release Button">
    <StackLayout>
        <Button Text="Press to Rotate Text!"
                VerticalOptions="Center"
                HorizontalOptions="Center"
                Pressed="OnButtonPressed"
                Released="OnButtonReleased" />
        <Label x:Name="label"
               Text="Press and hold the Button above"
               FontSize="18"
               VerticalOptions="Center"
               HorizontalOptions="Center" />
    </StackLayout>
</ContentPage>
```

The code-behind file animates the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Label> when a `Pressed` event occurs, but suspends the rotation when a `Released` event occurs:

```csharp
public partial class PressAndReleaseButtonPage : ContentPage
{
    IDispatcherTimer timer;
    Stopwatch stopwatch = new Stopwatch();

    public PressAndReleaseButtonPage()
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        timer = Dispatcher.CreateTimer();
        timer.Interval = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(16);
        timer.Tick += (s, e) =>
        {
            label.Rotation = 360 * (stopwatch.Elapsed.TotalSeconds % 1);
        };
    }

    void OnButtonPressed(object sender, EventArgs args)
    {
        stopwatch.Start();
        timer.Start();
    }

    void OnButtonReleased(object sender, EventArgs args)
    {
        stopwatch.Stop();
        timer.Stop();
    }
}
```

The result is that the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Label> only rotates while a finger is in contact with the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button>, and stops when the finger is released.

## Button visual states

<xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> has a `Pressed` <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.VisualState> that can be used to initiate a visual change to the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> when pressed, provided that it's enabled.

The following XAML example shows how to define a visual state for the `Pressed` state:

```xaml
<Button Text="Click me!"
        ...>
    <VisualStateManager.VisualStateGroups>
        <VisualStateGroup x:Name="CommonStates">
            <VisualState x:Name="Normal">
                <VisualState.Setters>
                    <Setter Property="Scale"
                            Value="1" />
                </VisualState.Setters>
            </VisualState>
            <VisualState x:Name="Pressed">
                <VisualState.Setters>
                    <Setter Property="Scale"
                            Value="0.8" />
                </VisualState.Setters>
            </VisualState>
        </VisualStateGroup>
    </VisualStateManager.VisualStateGroups>
</Button>
```

In this example, the `Pressed` <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.VisualState> specifies that when the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> is pressed, its `Scale` property will be changed from its default value of 1 to 0.8. The `Normal` <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.VisualState> specifies that when the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> is in a normal state, its `Scale` property will be set to 1. Therefore, the overall effect is that when the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> is pressed, it's rescaled to be slightly smaller, and when the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> is released, it's rescaled to its default size.

For more information about visual states, see [Visual states](~/user-interface/visual-states.md).

## Use bitmaps with buttons

The <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> class defines an <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ImageSource> property that allows you to display a small bitmap image on the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button>, either alone or in combination with text. You can also specify how the text and image are arranged. The <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ImageSource> property is of type <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ImageSource>, which means that the bitmaps can be loaded from a file, embedded resource, URI, or stream.

<!-- > [!NOTE]
> While a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> can load an animated GIF, it will only display the first frame of the GIF. -->

Bitmaps aren't scaled to fit a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button>. The best size is usually between 32 and 64 device-independent units, depending on how large you want the bitmap to be.

You can specify how the `Text` and <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.ImageSource> properties are arranged on the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> using the `ContentLayout` property of <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button>. This property is of type `ButtonContentLayout`, and its constructor has two arguments:

- A member of the `ImagePosition` enumeration: `Left`, `Top`, `Right`, or `Bottom` indicating how the bitmap appears relative to the text.
- A `double` value for the spacing between the bitmap and the text.

In XAML, you can create a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> and set the `ContentLayout` property by specifying only the enumeration member, or the spacing, or both in any order separated by commas:

```xaml
<Button Text="Button text"
        ImageSource="button.png"
        ContentLayout="Right, 20" />
```

The equivalent C# code is:

```csharp
Button button = new Button
{
    Text = "Button text",
    ImageSource = new FileImageSource
    {
        File = "button.png"
    },
    ContentLayout = new Button.ButtonContentLayout(Button.ButtonContentLayout.ImagePosition.Right, 20)
};
```

## Disable a Button

Sometimes an app enters a state where a <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> click is not a valid operation. In such cases, the <xref:Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Button> can be disabled by setting its `IsEnabled` property to `false`.
