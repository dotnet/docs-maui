# Controls

[![Browse sample.](~/media/code-sample.png) Browse the sample](/samples/dotnet/maui-samples/userinterface-controlgallery)

The user interface of a .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) app is constructed of objects that map to the native controls of each target platform.

The main control groups used to create the user interface of a .NET MAUI app are pages, layouts, and views. A .NET MAUI page generally occupies the full screen or window. The page usually contains a layout, which contains views and possibly other layouts. Pages, layouts, and views derive from the `VisualElement` class. This class provides a variety of properties, methods, and events that are useful in derived classes.

> [!NOTE]
> `ListView` and `TableView` also support the use of cells. Cells are specialized elements used for items in a table, that describe how each item should be rendered.

## Pages

.NET MAUI apps consist of one or more pages. A page usually occupies all of the screen, or window, and each page typically contains at least one layout.

.NET MAUI contains the following pages:

| Page | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ContentPage` | `ContentPage` displays a single view, and is the most common page type. For more information, see [ContentPage](~/user-interface/pages/contentpage.md). |
| `FlyoutPage` | `FlyoutPage` is a page that manages two related pages of information â€“ a flyout page that presents items, and a detail page that presents details about items on the flyout page. For more information, see [FlyoutPage](~/user-interface/pages/flyoutpage.md). |
| `NavigationPage` | `NavigationPage` provides a hierarchical navigation experience where you're able to navigate through pages, forwards and backwards, as desired. For more information, see [NavigationPage](~/user-interface/pages/navigationpage.md). |
| `TabbedPage` | `TabbedPage` consists of a series of pages that are navigable by tabs across the top or bottom of the page, with each tab loading the page content. For more information, see [TabbedPage](~/user-interface/pages/tabbedpage.md). |

## Layouts

.NET MAUI layouts are used to compose user-interface controls into visual structures, and each layout typically contains multiple views. Layout classes typically contain logic to set the position and size of child elements.

.NET MAUI contains the following layouts:

| Layout | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `AbsoluteLayout` | `AbsoluteLayout` positions child elements at specific locations relative to its parent. For more information, see [AbsoluteLayout](~/user-interface/layouts/absolutelayout.md). |
| `BindableLayout` | `BindableLayout` enables any layout class to generate its content by binding to a collection of items, with the option to set the appearance of each item. For more information, see [BindableLayout](~/user-interface/layouts/bindablelayout.md).
| `FlexLayout`| `FlexLayout` enables its children to be stacked or wrapped with different alignment and orientation options. `FlexLayout` is based on the CSS Flexible Box Layout Module, known as *flex layout* or *flex-box*. For more information, see [FlexLayout](~/user-interface/layouts/flexlayout.md). |
| `Grid` | `Grid` positions its child elements in a grid of rows and columns. For more information, see [Grid](~/user-interface/layouts/grid.md). |
| `HorizontalStackLayout` | `HorizontalStackLayout` positions child elements in a horizontal stack. For more information, see [HorizontalStackLayout](~/user-interface/layouts/horizontalstacklayout.md). |
| `StackLayout` | `StackLayout` positions child elements in either a vertical or horizontal stack. For more information, see [StackLayout](~/user-interface/layouts/stacklayout.md). |
| `VerticalStackLayout` | `VerticalStackLayout` positions child elements in a vertical stack. For more information, see [VerticalStackLayout](~/user-interface/layouts/verticalstacklayout.md). |

## Views

.NET MAUI views are the UI objects such as labels, buttons, and sliders that are commonly known as *controls* or *widgets* in other environments.

.NET MAUI contains the following views:

| View | Description |
