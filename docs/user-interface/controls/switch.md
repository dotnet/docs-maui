# Switch

The .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) `Switch` control is a horizontal toggle button that can be manipulated by the user to toggle between on and off states, which are represented by a `boolean` value.

[!INCLUDE [docs under construction](~/includes/preview-note.md)]

The following screenshot shows a `Switch` control in its on and off toggle states:

The `Switch` control defines the following properties:

- `IsToggled` is a `boolean` value that indicates whether the `Switch` is on. The default value of this property is `false`.
- `OnColor` is a `Color` that affects how the `Switch` is rendered in the toggled, or on state.
- `ThumbColor` is the `Color` of the switch thumb.

These properties are backed by `BindableProperty` objects, which means they can be styled and be the target of data bindings.

The `Switch` control defines a `Toggled` event that's raised when the `IsToggled` property changes, either through user manipulation or when an application sets the `IsToggled` property. The `ToggledEventArgs` object that accompanies the `Toggled` event has a single property named `Value`, of type `bool`. When the event is raised, the value of the `Value` property reflects the new value of the `IsToggled` property.

## Create a Switch

A `Switch` can be instantiated in XAML. Its `IsToggled` property can be set to toggle the `Switch`. By default, the `IsToggled` property is `false`. The following example shows how to instantiate a `Switch` in XAML with the optional `IsToggled` property set:

```xaml
<Switch IsToggled="true"/>
```

A `Switch` can also be created in code:

```csharp
Switch switchControl = new Switch { IsToggled = true };
```

## Switch appearance

In addition to the properties that `Switch` inherits from the `View` class, `Switch` also defines `OnColor` and `ThumbColor` properties. The `OnColor` property can be set to define the `Switch` color when it is toggled to its on state, and the `ThumbColor` property can be set to define the `Color` of the switch thumb. The following example shows how to instantiate a `Switch` in XAML with these properties set:

```xaml
<Switch OnColor="Orange"
        ThumbColor="Green" />
```

The properties can also be set when creating a `Switch` in code:

```csharp
Switch switch = new Switch { OnColor = Colors.Orange, ThumbColor = Colors.Green };
```

The following screenshot shows the `Switch` in its on and off toggle states, with the `OnColor` and `ThumbColor` properties set:

## Respond to a Switch state change

When the `IsToggled` property changes, either through user manipulation or when an application sets the `IsToggled` property, the `Toggled` event fires. An event handler for this event can be registered to respond to the change:

```xaml
<Switch Toggled="OnToggled" />
```

The code-behind file contains the handler for the `Toggled` event:

```csharp
void OnToggled(object sender, ToggledEventArgs e)
{
    // Perform an action after examining e.Value
}
```

The `sender` argument in the event handler is the `Switch` responsible for firing this event. You can use the `sender` property to access the `Switch` object, or to distinguish between multiple `Switch` objects sharing the same `Toggled` event handler.

The `Toggled` event handler can also be assigned in code:

```csharp
Switch switchControl = new Switch {...};
switchControl.Toggled += (sender, e) =>
{
    // Perform an action after examining e.Value
};
```

## Data bind a Switch

The `Toggled` event handler can be eliminated by using data binding and triggers to respond to a `Switch` changing toggle states.

```xaml
<Switch x:Name="styleSwitch" />
<Label Text="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, elit rutrum, enim hendrerit augue vitae praesent sed non, lorem aenean quis praesent pede.">
    <Label.Triggers>
        <DataTrigger TargetType="Label"
                     Binding="{Binding Source={x:Reference styleSwitch}, Path=IsToggled}"
                     Value="true">
            <Setter Property="FontAttributes"
                    Value="Italic, Bold" />
            <Setter Property="FontSize"
                    Value="18" />
        </DataTrigger>
    </Label.Triggers>
</Label>
```

In this example, the `Label` uses a binding expression in a `DataTrigger` to monitor the `IsToggled` property of the `Switch` named `styleSwitch`. When this property becomes `true`, the `FontAttributes` and `FontSize` properties of the `Label` are changed. When the `IsToggled` property returns to `false`, the `FontAttributes` and `FontSize` properties of the `Label` are reset to their initial state.

## Switch visual states

`Switch` has `On` and `Off` visual states that can be used to initiate a visual change when the `IsToggled` property changes.

The following XAML example shows how to define visual states for the `On` and `Off` states:

```xaml
<Switch IsToggled="True">
    <VisualStateManager.VisualStateGroups>
        <VisualStateGroup x:Name="CommonStates">
            <VisualState x:Name="On">
                <VisualState.Setters>
                    <Setter Property="ThumbColor"
                            Value="MediumSpringGreen" />
                </VisualState.Setters>
            </VisualState>
            <VisualState x:Name="Off">
                <VisualState.Setters>
                    <Setter Property="ThumbColor"
                            Value="Red" />
                </VisualState.Setters>
            </VisualState>
        </VisualStateGroup>
    </VisualStateManager.VisualStateGroups>
</Switch>
```

In this example, the `On` `VisualState` specifies that when the `IsToggled` property is `true`, the `ThumbColor` property will be set to medium spring green. The `Off` `VisualState` specifies that when the `IsToggled` property is `false`, the `ThumbColor` property will be set to red. Therefore, the overall effect is that when the `Switch` is in an off position its thumb is red, and its thumb is medium spring green when the `Switch` is in an on position:

## Disable a Switch

An app may enter a state where the `Switch` being toggled is not a valid operation. In such cases, the `Switch` can be disabled by setting its `IsEnabled` property to `false`. This will prevent users from being able to manipulate the `Switch`.
