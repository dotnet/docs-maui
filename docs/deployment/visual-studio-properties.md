- **Platform target**

  Specifies the processor to be targeted by the output file. Choose `Any CPU` to specify that any processor is acceptable, allowing the application to run on the broadest range of hardware.

  Typically this is set to `Any CPU` and the runtime identifier setting is used to target a CPU platform.

  | Option | Description |
  | ------ | ----------- |
  | `Any CPU` | (Default) Compiles your assembly to run on any platform. Your application runs as a 64-bit process whenever possible and falls back to 32-bit when only that mode is available. |
  | `x86` | Compiles your assembly to be run by the 32-bit, x86-compatible runtime. |
  | `x64` | Compiles your assembly to be run by the 64-bit runtime on a computer that supports the AMD64 or EM64T instruction set. |
  | `ARM32` | Compiles your assembly to run on a computer that has an Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) processor. |
  | `ARM64` | Compiles your assembly to run by the 64-bit runtime on a computer that has an Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) processor that supports the A64 instruction set. |

- **Nullable**

  Specifies the project-wide C# nullable context. For more information, see [Nullable References](/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references#nullable-contexts).

  | `Disable`     | Nullable warnings are disabled. All reference type variables are nullable reference types. |
  | `Enable`      | The compiler enables all null reference analysis and all language features. |
  | `Warnings`    | The compiler performs all null analysis and emits warnings when code might dereference null. |
  | `Annotations` | The compiler doesn't perform null analysis or emit warnings when code might dereference null. |

- **Implicit global usings**

  Enables implicit global usings to be declared by the project SDK. This is enabled by default and imports many of the .NET MAUI namespaces automatically to all code files. Code files don't need to add `using` statements for common .NET MAUI namespaces. For more information, see [MSBuild properties - ImplicitUsings](/dotnet/core/project-sdk/msbuild-props#implicitusings).

- **Unsafe code**

  Allow code that uses the `unsafe` keyword to compile. This is disabled by default.

- **Optimize code**

  Enable compiler optimizations for smaller, faster, and more efficient output. There is an option for each target platform, in Debug or Release mode. Generally, this is enabled for Release mode, as the code is optimized for speed at the expense of helpful debugging information.

- **Target Android version**

  The target API level of the Android device where the app expects to run. This API level is used at run-time, unlike Target Framework, which is used at build time. Android uses this version as a way to provide forward compatibility. Also referred to as `targetSdkVersion`, this should match Target Framework `compileSdkVersion`.

### Options

Miscellaneous options for building an Android app.

- **Android package format**

  Either `apk` or `bundle`, which packages the Android application as an APK file or Android App Bundle, respectively. This can be set individually for both Debug and Release modes.

  App Bundles are the latest format for Android release builds that are intended for submission on Google Play.

  The default value is `apk`.

  When `bundle` is selected, other MSBuild properties are set:

  - `AndroidUseAapt2` is set to `True`.
  - `AndroidUseApkSigner` is set to `False`.
  - `AndroidCreatePackagePerAbi` is set to `False`.

- **Fast deployment (debug mode only)**

  When enabled, deploys the app faster than normal to the target device. This process speeds up the build/deploy/debug cycle because the package isn't reinstalled when only assemblies are changed. Only the updated assemblies are resynchronized to the target device.

  This is enabled by default.

- **Generate per ABI**

  When enabled, generates one Android package (apk) per selected Application Binary Interface (ABI). This is disabled by default.

- **Use incremental packaging**

  When enabled, uses the incremental Android packaging system (aapt2). This is enabled by default.

- **Multi-dex**

  When enabled, allows the Android build system to use multidex. The default is disabled.

- **Code shrinker**

  Selects the code shrinker to use.

  - `ProGuard` (default) is considered the legacy code shrinker.
  - `r8` is the next-generation tool which converts Java byte code to optimized dex code.

- **Uncompressed resources**

  Leaves the specified resource extensions uncompressed. Separate extensions with a semicolon `;`. For example: `.mp3;.dll;.png`.

- **Developer instrumentation**

  When enabled, developer instrumentation is provided for debugging and profiling. This can be set for individually for both Debug and Release modes.

  The default is enabled for Debug builds.

- **Debugger**

  Selects which debugger to use. The default is `.NET (Xamarin)`, which is used for managed code. The C++ debugger can be selected to debug native libraries used by the app.

- **AOT**

  Enables Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation. This can be set for individually for both Debug and Release modes.

  The default is enabled for Release builds.

- **LLVM**

  Enables the LLVM optimizing compiler. The default is disabled.

- **Startup Tracing**

  Enables startup tracing. This can be set for individually for both Debug and Release modes.

  The default is enabled for Release builds.

- **Garbage Collection**

  When enabled, uses the concurrent garbage collector. Defaults to enabled.

- **Enable trimming**

  When enabled, trims the application during publishing. This can be set for individually for both Debug and Release modes. For more information, see [Trim self-contained deployments and executables](/dotnet/core/deploying/trimming/trim-self-contained) and [Trim options](/dotnet/core/deploying/trimming/trimming-options).

  The default is enabled for Release builds.

- **Trimming granularity**

  Controls how aggressively IL is discarded. There are two modes to select from:

  - `Link` enables member-level trimming, which removes unused members from types.
  - `CopyUsed` (default) enableds assembly-level trimming, which keeps an entire assembly if any part of it is used.

- **Java max heap size**

  Set this value to increase the size of memory that an app can use. For example, a value of `2G` increases the heap size to 2 gigabytes. Note that there isn't a guarantee of how large the heap will be, and requesting too much heap memory may force other apps to terminate prematurely.

  The default is `1G`.

- **Additional Java options**

  Specifies additional command-line options to pass to the Java compiler when building a _.dex_ file. From the command line, you can type `java -help` to see the available options.

### Package Signing

When enabled, signs the _.APK_ file using the keystore details. This is disabled by default.

## iOS

These are iOS-specific .NET MAUI settings.

### Build

Settings related to building the iOS app.

- **Linker behavior**

  The linker can strip out unused methods, properties, fields, events, structs, and even classes in order to reduce the overall size of the application. You can add a `Preserve` attribute to any of these in order to prevent the linker from stripping it out if it's needed for serialization or reflection.

  > [!WARNING]
  > Enabling this feature may hinder debugging, as it may strip out property accessors that would allow you to inspect the state of your objects.

  Options are:

  - `Don't link`
  - `Link Framework SDKs only` (default)
  - `Link All`

- **LLVM**

  When enabled, uses the LLVM optimized compiler. This can be set for individually for both Debug and Release modes.

  The default is enabled for Release builds.

- **Float operations**

  Performs all 32-bit float operations as 64-bit float operations.

- **Symbols**

  When enabled, strips native debugging symbols from the output. This is enabled by default.

- **Garbage collector**

  When enabled, uses the concurrent garbage collector. This is disabled by default.

- **Additional arguments**

  Additional command line arguments to be passed to the application bundling code.

- **Optimization**

  When enabled, optimizes _.PNG_ images. This is enabled by default.

### Bundle Signing

These settings are related to generating and signing the app bundle.

- **Scheme**

  Configures the signing scheme for the bundle. It can be set to one of the following values:

  - `Manual provisioning`: With this value, you'll be responsible for setting provisioning profiles and signing certificates yourself.
  - `Automatic provisioning`: (default) With this value, Visual Studio will set provisioning profiles and signing certificates for you, which simplifies app deployment when testing on a device.

- **Signing identity**

  A signing identity is the certificate and private key pair that's used for code-signing app bundle using Apple's codesign utility.

  - `Developer (automatic)` (default)
  - `Distribution (automatic)`

- **Provisioning profile**

  Provisioning profiles are a way of tying together a team of developers with an App ID and, potentially, a list of test devices. The provisioning profiles list is filtered to only show provisioning profiles that match both the chosen identity and the App ID (aka bundle identifier) set in the _Info.plist_. If the provisioning profile that you're looking for isn't in the list, make sure that you've chosen a compatible identity and double-check that the bundle identifier set in your _Info.plist_ is correct.

- **Custom Entitlements**

  The plist file to use for entitlements. For more information, see [Entitlements](../ios/entitlements.md).

- **Custom Resource Rules**

  The plist file containing custom rules used by Apple's codesign utility.

  > [!NOTE]
  > As of Mac OSX 10.10, Apple has deprecated the use of custom resource rules. So, this setting should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.

- **Additional arguments**

  Additional command line arguments to be passed to Apple's codesign utility during the code-signing phase of the build.

### Debug

These are settings related to debugging.

- **Debugging**

  When enabled, turns on debugging. The default is based on the current profile. Debug profiles enable debugging, while Release profiles disable debugging.

- **Pre-fetch Order**

  The tags of the on-demand resources that are downloaded after the app is installed. Separate tags with a semicolon `;`.

- **Embed**

  When enabled, embeds on-demand resources in the app bundle. This is enabled by default. Disable this setting to use the **Web server**.

- **Web server**

  The URI of a web server that hosts on-demand resources.

### Run Options

Options related to running the app on an iOS or macOS device.

- **Execution mode**

  This setting determines how the app is run on the target device.
