# Installation

To create .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) apps, you need the latest preview versions of both Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.

[!INCLUDE [docs under construction](~/includes/preview-note.md)]

Visual Studio 2022 should install .NET 6 for you, but if it's missing, download it from the [Download .NET 6.0 site](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0).

> [!NOTE]
> If you previously used these instructions to install .NET MAUI, note the absence of the `maui-check` tool. This tool is no longer required to get .NET MAUI working in Visual Studio.

## Visual Studio workloads

To create .NET MAUI apps, you'll need [Visual Studio 2022 Preview 4 or later](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/vs2022/). Either install Visual Studio, or modify the installation and check the following **workloads**:

- ASP.NET and web development (required for Blazor Desktop and the `BlazorWebView` control)
- Mobile development with .NET
- .NET Desktop Development
- Desktop development with C++
- Universal Windows Platform development

Under the **Installation** > **Mobile development with .NET** section, check the **.NET MAUI** optional workload:

## More requirements

.NET MAUI requires the Android 31 SDK for development. Install the following items:

- [Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk)

  You may notice that Visual Studio installs a version of Microsoft OpenJDK, however, you need to install the Microsoft OpenJDK 11, available from the [OpenJDK page](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk). After you install this version of the OpenJDK, Visual Studio will automatically pick it up. If it doesn't, set the path to the OpenJDK in the **Java Development Kit Location** field, when configuring the Android 31 SDK..

- Android 31 SDK

  The Android 31 SDK can be installed through Visual Studio. These steps are critical in getting Visual Studio to recognize the Android SDK and to creating a .NET MAUI app.

  01. Open Visual Studio.
  01. If the **Open Recent/Get Started** window opens, choose **Continue without code**.
  01. In the main Visual Studio window, use the menu to choose **Tools** > **Options...**. The options window is displayed.
  01. In the search bar, type `android`. Select the **Xamarin** > **Android Settings** category.
  01. The **Android SDK Location** should point to a default of _C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk_. It probably has a red `X` indicating it's not configured correctly. This is normal.
  01. Select the **OK** button to close the window. Visual Studio will now try to load the Android SDKs.

  Visual Studio should now be able to load the Android SDK Manager. The next step is to install the Android 31 SDK:

  01. In the main Visual Studio window, use the menu to choose **Tools** > **Android** > **Android SDK Manager...**
  01. In the Android SDK Manager, check the **Android 12.0 API Level 31** item.
  01. Select the **Apply Changes** button.

      :::image type="content" source="installation-images/vs-android-sdk.png" alt-text="Visual Studio android SDK manager window for .NET MAUI.":::

For these changes to take effect, you may need to restart Visual Studio.

## Windows (WinUI 3)

To create apps that target Windows UI Library (WinUI) 3, install the following Visual Studio extension:

- [Single-project MSIX Packaging Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ProjectReunion.MicrosoftSingleProjectMSIXPackagingToolsDev17)

  For more information about the required workloads and components for WinUI 3 development, see [Required workloads and components](/windows/apps/project-reunion/set-up-your-development-environment#required-workloads-and-components).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You **must** uncomment the Windows `TargetFrameworks` from your _.csproj_ file in order to enable windows development.

## Blazor and WebView

To use the `WebView` or `BlazorWebView` controls on Windows, install the **WebView2 Runtime**:

- [Microsoft Edge WebView2 installer](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/)
