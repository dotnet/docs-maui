To create .NET MAUI apps in Visual Studio, you'll need the latest [Visual Studio 2022 Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/vs2022/) with the following workloads installed:

- Mobile development with .NET, **including the optional workload .NET MAUI**
- Universal Windows Platform development

- .NET Desktop Development
- ASP.NET and web development (required for Blazor Desktop and the `BlazorWebView` control)

For more information about the required workloads and components for WinUI 3 development, see [Required workloads and components](/windows/apps/project-reunion/set-up-your-development-environment#required-workloads-and-components).

> [!IMPORTANT]

To use the `WebView` or `BlazorWebView` controls on Windows you need to install the WebView2 package:

.NET MAUI requires the Android 31 SDK for development. The Android 31 SDK can be installed through [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

Currently .NET MAUI has a dependency on OpenJDK. OpenJDK can be installed [from the microsoft openJDK page](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk).
