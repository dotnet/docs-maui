# Installation

Developing native, cross-platform .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) apps requires Visual Studio 2022 17.3 or greater, or Visual Studio 2022 for Mac 17.4 or greater.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD025 -->
# [Visual Studio](#tab/vswin)
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD025 -->

To start developing native, cross-platform .NET MAUI apps on Windows, install Visual Studio 2022 17.3 or greater by following the [installation](#installation) steps.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 17.3 or greater. For information about supported operating systems, hardware, supported languages, and additional requirements and guidance, see [Visual Studio 2022 System Requirements](/visualstudio/releases/2022/system-requirements).

To build, sign, and deploy .NET MAUI apps for iOS, you'll also need:

- A Mac that is compatible with the latest version of Xcode. For more information, see Apple's [minimum requirements documentation](https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/)
- The latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode).
- An [Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/account) and paid [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs) enrollment. An Apple ID is required to deploy apps to devices, and to submit apps to the Apple Store.

Alternatively, to deploy debug builds of your app directly from Windows to your iOS device with [hot restart](~/deployment/hot-restart.md), you'll need:

- An [Apple Developer account](https://appleid.apple.com/account) and paid [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs) enrollment.

## Installation

1. To create .NET MAUI apps, you'll need the latest version of Visual Studio 2022:

    - [Download Visual Studio 2022 Community](https://c2rsetup.officeapps.live.com/c2r/downloadVS.aspx?sku=Community&channel=Release&Version=VS2022&source=VSLandingPage&add=Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.CoreEditor&add=Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NetCrossPlat;includeRecommended&cid=2305)

    - [Download Visual Studio 2022 Professional](https://c2rsetup.officeapps.live.com/c2r/downloadVS.aspx?sku=Professional&channel=Release&Version=VS2022&source=VSLandingPage&add=Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.CoreEditor&add=Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NetCrossPlat;includeRecommended&cid=2305)

    - [Download Visual Studio 2022 Enterprise](https://c2rsetup.officeapps.live.com/c2r/downloadVS.aspx?sku=Enterprise&channel=Release&Version=VS2022&source=VSLandingPage&add=Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.CoreEditor&add=Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NetCrossPlat;includeRecommended&cid=2305)

1. Either install Visual Studio, or modify your existing installation, and install the .NET Multi-platform App UI development workload with its default optional installation options:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD025 -->
# [Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/vsmac)
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD025 -->

To start developing native, cross-platform .NET MAUI apps on macOS, install Visual Studio 2022 for Mac 17.4 or greater by following the [installation](#installation) steps.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 for Mac 17.4 or greater. For information about supported operating systems, hardware, supported languages, and additional requirements and guidance, see [Visual Studio 2022 for Mac System Requirements](/visualstudio/releases/2022/mac-system-requirements).

To build, sign, and deploy .NET MAUI apps for iOS or macOS, you'll also need:

- A Mac that is compatible with the latest version of Xcode. For more information, see Apple's [minimum requirements documentation](https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/)
- The latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode).
- An [Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/account) and paid [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs) enrollment. An Apple ID is required to deploy apps to devices, and to submit apps to the Apple Store.

## Installation

1. To create .NET MAUI apps, you'll need the latest Visual Studio for Mac:

    > [!div class="button"]
    > [Download Visual Studio 2022 for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/)

1. Either install Visual Studio 2022 for Mac, or modify your existing installation, and ensure that the following workloads are installed:

    - .NET
    - .NET MAUI
    - Android
    - iOS

    :::image type="content" source="media/installation/vsmac/mac-maui-workloads.png" alt-text="Visual Studio for Mac .NET MAUI workloads.":::
    :::image type="content" source="media/installation/vsmac/mac-legacy-workloads.png" alt-text="Visual Studio for Mac legacy workloads.":::

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For new installations of Visual Studio 2022 for Mac, selecting the .NET MAUI workload will automatically select the Android and iOS workloads, which are currently required for .NET MAUI development.

    <!-- At some point, the legacy workloads shouldn't be required. -->

If you have network trouble while installing in a corporate environment, review the [installing behind a firewall or proxy](#installation-behind-a-firewall-or-proxy-server) instructions.

## Installation behind a firewall or proxy server

To install Visual Studio 2022 for Mac behind a firewall, certain endpoints must be made accessible in order to allow downloads of the required tools and updates for your software. For more information about configuring your network to allow access to the required endpoints, see [Install and use Visual Studio for Mac behind a firewall or proxy server](/visualstudio/mac/install-behind-a-firewall-or-proxy-server).
