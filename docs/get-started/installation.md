> [!NOTE]
> .NET MAUI support in Visual Studio Code is still in preview. Try it out and [share your feedback](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dotnettools/issues)!

## Install Visual Studio Code and the .NET MAUI extension

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
1. In the Extensions tab, search for ".NET MAUI" and install the [.NET MAUI extension](https://aka.ms/mauidevkit-marketplace). The .NET MAUI extension automatically installs the [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) and [C#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) extensions, which are required for the .NET MAUI extension to run.  

    :::image type="content" source="media/installation/vscode/maui-extension-preview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Visual Studio Code extension pane showing the .NET MAUI extension":::

> [!NOTE]
> The .NET MAUI extension requires the C# Dev Kit and prerelease C# extensions. You must sign into C# Dev Kit to use the .NET MAUI extension's functionality. See [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/announcing-csharp-dev-kit-for-visual-studio-code/) for more information about C# Dev Kit and its family of extensions.

## Install .NET and .NET MAUI workloads

1. Install [.NET 8](/dotnet/core/install/windows).

    On Windows, it's recommended to use the Visual Studio installer to manage .NET and the .NET MAUI workload installations. Instructions on using the Visual Studio installer can be found [here](./installation.md?tabs=vswin).

1. Install the .NET MAUI workload.

    On Windows and macOS, run the following command in a terminal:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet workload install maui
    ```

    On Linux, run the following command in a terminal:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet workload install maui-android
    ```

## Set up target platforms

To debug a .NET MAUI app in Visual Studio Code, you need to have a valid target platform for your development machine's operating system:

| Your Operating System | Supported Target Platforms |
|---|---|
| Windows | Windows, Android |
| macOS | Android, iOS, macOS |
| Linux | Android |

### iOS and macOS

To debug to an iOS or macOS target in Visual Studio Code:

1. Install the version of Xcode that's required by the version of .NET MAUI that you're using. For information, see [Release versions](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/wiki/Release-Versions). The latest stable Xcode release can be downloaded from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).
1. Run `xcode-select --install` in a terminal to acquire the Xcode command line tools.

### Android

To debug to an Android target in Visual Studio Code:

1. Install [Microsoft OpenJDK 17](/java/openjdk/download#openjdk-17).
1. Install the Android SDK via one of the following approaches:
    * **(Recommended)** Create a new .NET MAUI project (`dotnet new maui`) and use the [InstallAndroidDependencies target](#using-the-installandroiddependencies-target).
    * Install via Visual Studio (Windows only).
    * Install via Android Studio.
    * Install via your preferred package manager on Linux.

## Troubleshooting

You might face issues when setting up the .NET MAUI extension for Visual Studio Code. If you're still facing issues after following the below troubleshooting steps, please [report an issue](#provide-feedback).

### Project creation

If you try to create a new project and the file explorer keeps popping up in an infinite loop, you may not be selecting an empty folder. Check that there are no hidden files or folders, create a new folder, or create your .NET MAUI app from the command line using `dotnet new maui`.

#### Using the InstallAndroidDependencies target

.NET 8 has a build target that helps set up your Android environment for you. Run the following command in a terminal to configure your machine and set up your Android environment:

```dotnetcli
dotnet build -t:InstallAndroidDependencies -f:net8.0-android -p:AndroidSdkDirectory="<AndroidSdkPath>" -p:JavaSdkDirectory="<JavaSdkPath>" -p:AcceptAndroidSDKLicenses=True
```

In the command above:

* `AndroidSdkDirectory="<AndroidSdkPath>"`: installs or updates Android dependencies to the specified absolute path.
  * Windows: the suggested AndroidSdkPath is `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Android/Sdk`.
  * MacOS: the suggested AndroidSdkPath is `$HOME/Library/Android/sdk`.
* `JavaSdkDirectory="<JavaSdkPath>"`: installs Java to the specified absolute path.
* `AcceptAndroidSDKLicenses=True`: accepts the required Android licenses for development.

#### There's an error that the Android SDK or Java SDK was not found

* Open the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) and search for the `.NET MAUI: Configure Android` command. Select both "Set Android SDK path" and "Set Android JDK path" and validate that they point to installations of each.
  * The Android SDK folder should have sub-folders such as `build-tools`, `cmdline-tools`, and `platform-tools`.
  * The Java OpenJDK folder should have sub-folders such as `bin`, `lib`, and more.
  * On Windows, if you install via Visual Studio, the Java SDK will be in `C:\Program Files\Microsoft\` and Android SDK will be in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk`.
* Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to a valid Java OpenJDK path.
* Set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to your Android SDK path.
* Check your minimum versions of installed Android dependencies:
  * build-tools >= 34.0.0
  * cmdline-tools == 11.0
  * platforms;android-34*
  * .NET 8: platform-tools = 34.0.5

#### There's an error that Android licenses aren't accepted

In an **elevated** command prompt or terminal, navigate to your Android SDK's `cmdline-tools/latest/bin/` folder and run `sdkmanager --licenses` then follow the CLI prompts.

#### My Android dependencies aren't loading in the Solution Explorer, but my app builds fine

This is a known issue if you install to `%APPDATA%` on Windows and will be fixed in a future release.

### iOS/Xcode Setup

* If you get an error that Xcode is not found, run `xcode-select --install` in a terminal, then check that `xcode-select -p` points to your Xcode installation.
* If you're still facing issues, open Xcode itself to make sure it loads correctly. Once Xcode is open, navigate to **Xcode > Settings > Locations** and check that the **Command Line Tools** field is pointing to the correct Xcode.
* There is a known issue that sometimes you have to build your iOS/macOS app twice for it to deploy. This will be fixed in an upcoming release.

### Debugging issues

* Debugging can fail to start for multiple reasons. If there isn't a clear error in the Output window, first double check that you are using the ".NET MAUI" run configuration in Visual Studio Code.
* You can try a command line build from the terminal to see if the error is with your code or the .NET MAUI extension. For example, you could run `dotnet build -f:net8.0-android` to see if your Android build succeeds outside of Visual Studio Code. If this build succeeds, please [Report an Issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dotnettools/issues)

## Known Limitations

This extension is still in early preview, so there are a number of known limitations. Please [give us your feedback](#provide-feedback) on other features you'd like to see as we continue building this new experience.

* XAML editing capabilities are very lightweight - you get basic syntax highlighting and autocomplete. We're exploring how to improve the XAML experience in a future release.
* Currently, you can't switch the target framework for IntelliSense (it will show syntax highlighting for only the first target framework listed in your .csproj file). This capability is in progress.
* XAML and .NET Hot Reload are't currently supported.
* This extension hasn't yet been fully tested with the latest iOS and Xcode betas.

Please [give us your feedback](#provide-feedback) on other features you'd like to see as we continue building this new experience!
