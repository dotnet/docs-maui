# Build your first app

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create and run your first .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) app in Visual Studio 2022 on Windows or Visual Studio Code on Windows, macOS, or Linux. This will help to ensure that your development environment is correctly set up.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD025 -->
# [Visual Studio](#tab/vswin)
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD025 -->

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 17.12 or greater, with the .NET Multi-platform App UI workload installed. For more information, see [Installation](installation.md?tabs=visual-studio).

## Create an app

:::zone pivot="devices-android"

In this tutorial, you'll create your first .NET MAUI app in Visual Studio 2022 and run it on an Android emulator:

:::zone-end

:::zone pivot="devices-ios"

Developing .NET MAUI apps for iOS on Windows requires a Mac build host. If you don't specifically need to target iOS and don't have a Mac, consider getting started with Android or Windows instead.

In this tutorial, you'll create your first .NET MAUI app in Visual Studio and run it on an iOS simulator:

:::zone-end

:::zone pivot="devices-windows"

In this tutorial, you'll create your first .NET MAUI app in Visual Studio 2022 and run it on Windows:
