# iOS capabilities

On iOS, .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) apps run in a sandbox that provides a set of rules that limit access between the app and system resources or user data. Apple provides *capabilities*, also known as *app services*, as a means of extending functionality and widening the scope of what iOS apps can do. Capabilities enable you to add a deeper integration with platform features to your app, such as integration with Siri. For more information about capabilities, see [Capabilities](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/capabilities) on developer.apple.com.

Capabilities are added to your app's provisioning profile, and are used when code signing your app. The provisioning profile must contain an App ID, that matches your app's bundle identifier, with the required capabilities enabled. The provisioning profile can be created automatically in Visual Studio or Visual Studio for Mac, or manually in your Apple Developer Account.

Capabilities are closely related to the concept of entitlements. They both request the expansion of the sandbox your app runs in, to give it additional capabilities. Entitlements are typically added when developing your app, while capabilities are typically added when code signing your app for distribution. However, when automatic provisioning is enabled, adding certain entitlements to your app will also update the capabilities for your app in its provisioning profile. For more information about entitlements, see [Entitlements](entitlements.md).

## Add capabilities with Visual Studio

Capabilities can be added to a provisioning profile in Visual Studio or Visual Studio for Mac. This approach requires the use of automatic provisioning, and only works for a subset of capabilities. For more information about automatic provisioning, see [Automatic provisioning for iOS apps](~/ios/device-provisioning/automatic-provisioning.md).

The following list shows the capabilities that can be automatically provisioned using Visual Studio or Visual Studio for Mac:

- HealthKit
- HomeKit
- Hotspot configuration
- Inter-app audio
- Multipath
- Network extensions
- Near field communication tag reader
- Personal VPN
- Siri
- Wireless accessory configuration

In Visual Studio, all capabilities are added to your app's *Entitlements.plist* file. The capabilities listed above are also added to your provisioning profile. For more information about entitlements, including how to add an entitlements file to your project, see [Entitlements](entitlements.md).

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD025 -->

1. In Visual Studio, ensure that the IDE is paired to a Mac Build host. For more information, see [Pair to Mac for iOS development](~/ios/pair-to-mac.md).
1. In Visual Studio, enable automatic provisioning for your project. For more information, see [Enable automatic provisioning](~/ios/device-provisioning/automatic-provisioning.md#enable-automatic-provisioning).
1. In Visual Studio, add an *Entitlements.plist* file to your project. For more information, see [Add an Entitlements.plist file](entitlements.md#add-an-entitlementsplist-file).
1. In **Solution Explorer**, double-click the *Entitlements.plist* file from the **Platforms > iOS** folder of your .NET MAUI app project to open it in the entitlements editor.
1. In the entitlements editor, select and configure any entitlements required for your app:

1. Save the changes to your *Entitlements.plist* file to add the entitlement key/value pairs to the file, and add the app service to your App ID.

# [Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/vsmac)
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD025 -->

[!INCLUDE [Visual Studio for Mac end of life](~/includes/vsmac-eol.md)]

1. In Visual Studio for Mac, enable automatic provisioning for your project. For more information, see [Enable automatic provisioning](~/ios/device-provisioning/automatic-provisioning.md#enable-automatic-provisioning).
1. In the **Solution Window**, double-click the *Entitlements.plist* file from the *Platforms > iOS* folder of your .NET MAUI app project to open it in the entitlements editor. Then, change from the **Source** view to the **Entitlements** view:

    :::image type="content" source="media/capabilities/editor-source-vsmac.png" alt-text="Visual Studio for Mac iOS entitlements editor source view.":::

1. In the entitlements editor, select and configure any entitlements required for your app:

    :::image type="content" source="media/capabilities/editor-entitlements-vsmac.png" alt-text="Visual Studio for Mac iOS entitlements editor entitlements view.":::

1. Save the changes to your *Entitlements.plist* file to add the entitlement key/value pairs to the file, and add the app service to your App ID.

It may also be necessary to set privacy keys in *Info.plist*, for certain capabilities.

## Add capabilities in your Apple Developer Account

All capabilities can be added to your app's provisioning profile in your Apple Developer Account. This approach requires the use of manual provisioning, and works for all capabilities. For more information about manual provisioning, see [Manual provisioning for iOS apps](~/ios/device-provisioning/manual-provisioning.md).

Adding a capability in your Apple Developer Account is a multi-step process that requires creating an App ID, creating a provisioning profile, and enabling manual provisioning.

When adding a new capability to your provisioning profile, you should also add the same capability to your app's *Entitlements.plist* file and ensure that the app consumes this file. For more information, see [Entitlements](entitlements.md). It may also be necessary to set privacy keys in *Info.plist*, for certain capabilities.

### Create a provisioning profile

Once you've created an App ID you must create a provisioning profile for the App ID. This requires you to have previously created a signing certificate and added a device to your Apple Developer Account. For more information, see [Create a signing certificate](~/ios/device-provisioning/manual-provisioning.md#create-a-signing-certificate) and [Add a device](~/ios/device-provisioning/manual-provisioning.md#add-a-device).

A provisioning profile can be created with the following steps:

1. In a web browser, go to the [Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles/list) section of your Apple Developer Account and click the **+** button.
1. In the **Register a New Provisioning Profile** page, in the **Development** section select **iOS App Development** (or a distribution profile type from the **Distribution** section), and click the **Continue** button:

    :::image type="content" source="media/capabilities/provisioning-profile-ios.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a provisioning profile for iOS app development.":::

1. In the **Generate a Provisioning Profile** page, select your App ID and then click the **Continue** button:

    :::image type="content" source="media/capabilities/provisioning-profile-appid.png" alt-text="Screenshot of adding an App ID to a provisioning profile.":::

1. In the **Generate a Provisioning Profile** page, select the certificates to include in the provisioning profile and then click the **Continue** button:

    :::image type="content" source="media/capabilities/provisioning-profile-certificates.png" alt-text="Screenshot of adding a certificate to a provisioning profile.":::

1. In the **Generate a Provisioning Profile** page, select the devices that the app will be installed on and then click the **Continue** button:

    :::image type="content" source="media/capabilities/provisioning-profile-devices.png" alt-text="Screenshot of adding a device to a provisioning profile.":::

1. In the **Generate a Provisioning Profile** page, provide a provisioning profile name and then click the **Generate** button:

    :::image type="content" source="media/capabilities/provisioning-profile-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot of naming a provisioning profile.":::

### Enable manual provisioning

Once you've created a provisioning profile it must be downloaded by Visual Studio, and set as the provisioning profile for your project:

1. In Visual Studio, download the provisioning profile you've just created so that it's available for signing your app. For more information, see [Download provisioning profiles in Visual Studio](~/ios/device-provisioning/manual-provisioning.md#download-provisioning-profiles-in-visual-studio).
1. In Visual Studio, enable manual provisioning for your project. For more information, see [Enable manual provisioning](~/ios/device-provisioning/manual-provisioning.md#enable-manual-provisioning).
