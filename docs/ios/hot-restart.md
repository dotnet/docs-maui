# Deploy an iOS app using hot restart

Typically when building an app, your code is compiled and combined with other project resources to build an app bundle that's deployed to your simulator or device. With this model, when you make a change to your app, a new app bundle has to be built and deployed. While incremental builds can help to reduce compilation time, deployments usually take the same amount of time regardless of the size of the change.

.NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) hot restart enables you to quickly deploy a .NET MAUI app to a 64-bit local iOS device, from Visual Studio 2022, without requiring a Mac build host. It removes the need for a full app bundle rebuild by pushing changes to the existing app bundle that's already present on your locally connected iOS device. It supports changes to code files, resources, and project references, enabling you to quickly test changes to your app during its development.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hot restart isn't a replacement for the full build experience provided by a Mac build host. For example, it can only deploy apps that use the debug build configuration, and it doesn't support static libraries and frameworks, XCFrameworks, or binding resource packages. For more information, see [Limitations](#limitations).

There are a number of requirements that must be met to use hot restart to deploy a .NET MAUI app to a locally connected iOS device:

- You must be using Visual Studio 2022 version 17.3 or greater.
- You must have iTunes (Microsoft Store or 64-bit version) installed on your development machine.
- You must have an [Apple Developer account](https://appleid.apple.com/account) and paid [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs) enrollment.

## Deploy and debug using hot restart

After performing the initial setup, your local connected iOS device will appear in the debug target drop-down menu. To deploy and debug your app:

1. Ensure that your local connected iOS device is unlocked.
1. In the Visual Studio toolbar, select your local connected iOS device in the debug target drop-down, and click the **Run** button to build your app and deploy it to your local iOS device:

    :::image type="content" source="media/hot-restart/recognized-device-debug-target.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the chosen debug target for hot restart.":::

1. After deploying your app, Visual Studio will display the **Connecting Debugger** dialog:

    :::image type="content" source="media/hot-restart/launch-app-device.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the dialog asking you to launch the app on your device.":::

    Launch the app on your device and Visual Studio will connect the debugger to your running app, and the **Connecting Debugger** dialog will be dismissed.

While you're debugging your app, you can edit your C# code and press the restart button in the Visual Studio toolbar to restart your debug session with the new changes applied:

## Prevent code from executing

The `HOTRESTART` preprocessor symbol can be used to prevent code from executing when debugging with hot restart:

```csharp
#if !HOTRESTART
  // Code here won't be executed when debugging with hot restart
#endif
```

## Enable hot restart

Hot restart is enabled by default in Visual Studio 2022. If it's been previously disabled, it can be enabled by selecting **Tools > Options** from the Visual Studio menu bar. Next, in the **Options** dialog box, expand **Xamarin** and select **iOS Settings**. Then, ensure that **Enable Hot Restart** is checked:

## Limitations

There are limitations when using hot restart:

- It can only be used to deploy apps that use the debug build configuration. You'll still need a Mac build host to build, sign, and deploy your app for production purposes.
- Storyboard and XIB files aren't supported, and your app may crash if it attempts to load these at runtime.
- Static iOS libraries, and frameworks containing static libraries, aren't supported and you may see runtime errors or crashes if your app attempts to load these.
- XCFrameworks and binding resource packages are supported, as long as they don't contain static iOS libraries or frameworks with static libraries.
- Asset catalogs aren't supported. When using Hot Restart, your app will show a .NET icon and launch screen.

## Troubleshoot

iOS uses a watchdog that monitors app launch times and responsiveness, and terminates unresponsive apps. For example, the watchdog terminates apps that block the main thread for a significant time. On old iOS devices, the watchdog may terminate an app that's been deployed using hot restart before the debugger has connected to it. The workaround is to reduce the amount of processing performed in the app's startup path, and to use a more recent iOS device.
