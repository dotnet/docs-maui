# Capabilities

In iOS, apps run in a sandbox that provides a set of rules that limit access between the app and system resources or user data. Apple provides *capabilities*, also known as *app services*, as a means of extending functionality and widening the scope of what iOS apps can do. Capabilities allow you to add a deeper integration with platform features to your app, such as integration with Siri. For more information about capabilities, see [Capabilities](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/capabilities).
