1. In Visual Studio, ensure that the IDE is paired to a Mac Build host. For more information, see [Pair to Mac for iOS development](~/ios/pair-to-mac.md).

1. In the Visual Studio toolbar, use the **Debug Target** drop-down to select **iOS Remote Devices** and then **Remote Device**:

1. In the Visual Studio toolbar, use the **Solutions Configuration** drop-down to change from the debug configuration to the release configuration:

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click on your .NET MAUI app project and select **Properties**. Then, navigate to the **iOS Bundle Signing** tab and ensure that **Scheme** is set to **Manual Provisioning**, **Signing identity** is set to **Distribution (Automatic)**, and **Provisioning profile** is set to **Automatic**:

    These settings will ensure that Visual Studio will select the correct provisioning profile based on the bundle identifier in *Info.plist* (which is identical to the value of the **Application ID** property in your project file). Alternatively, set the **Signing identity** to the appropriate distribution certificate and **Provisioning profile** to the profile you created in the Apple developer portal.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click on your .NET MAUI app project and select **Publish...**:

    The **Archive Manager** will open and Visual Studio will begin to archive your app bundle:

    :::image type="content" source="../deployment/media/publish/vs/archive-manager.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the archive manager in Visual Studio.":::

    The archiving process signs the app with the certificate and provisioning profiles that you specified in the **iOS Bundle Signing** tab, for the selected solution configuration.

1. In the **Archive Manager**, once archiving has successfully completed, ensure your archive is selected and then select the **Distribute ...** button to begin the process of packaging your app for distribution:

    :::image type="content" source="../deployment/media/publish/vs/archive-manager-distribute.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the archive manager in Visual Studio once archiving is complete.":::

    The **Distribute - Select Channel** dialog will appear.
