## Deploy to device

After configuring provisioning in your .NET MAUI app project, the app can be deployed to a device with Visual Studio:

1. In Visual Studio, ensure that the IDE is paired to a Mac Build host. For more information, see [Pair to Mac for iOS development](~/ios/pair-to-mac.md).
1. Ensure that your iOS device is connected to your Mac build host via USB or WiFi. For more information about wireless deployment, see [Wireless deployment for .NET MAUI iOS apps](~/ios/wireless-deployment.md).
1. In the Visual Studio toolbar, use the **Debug Target** drop-down to select **iOS Remote Devices** and then the device that's connected to your Mac build host:

1. In the Visual Studio toolbar, press the green Start button to launch the app on your remote device:

> [!NOTE]
> An alternative approach to deploying a .NET MAUI iOS app to a device is to use hot restart. Hot restart enables you to deploy a .NET MAUI app to a 64-bit local iOS device, from Visual Studio, without requiring a Mac build host. For more information, see [Deploy an iOS app using hot restart](~/ios/hot-restart.md).
